Regardless, the two of them–even in the footage from 2010–are still “at the top of their game” as Sklar comments. Putting together a concert film is no easy feat but if anybody can put it together, it’s Frank Marshall. Between the first, second, and encore sets, this concert film can only feature so much material given the broadcast restraints. While I grew up knowing Frank Marshall as someone who produced or executive produced Steven Spielberg movies, the man knows his way with music. Whether it’s as a producer or director, Marshall has done a solid job with music documentaries in recent years. Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name is no exception. Ernie Gilbert’s editing is smart for how the film weaves between past and present as they start introducing the songs. Honestly, I think it’s genius. It’s been fifty years since the two of them first performed together. However, the concert tour took place in honor of the 40th anniversary. The two might have aged since they first performed together but neither Carole King nor James Taylor have lost a beat in all these years!", "Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads \"Your Ticket Reservation Details\".

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

However, it also seems to have elements of family drama and romance.", "docs": ["Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children’s actions. RELATED: 5 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.  If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.", "May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies. There’s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there’s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.  Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we’re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.  Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures – almost as if we’re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later.   Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning Steve Carell.", "Jim Carrey is at his all-time Jim Carrey-est, and Jeff Daniels is able to somehow keep up. Also, “Harry, your hands are freezing” is an incredibly underappreciated line. And on that note, this might be the most quotable movie of all time.   Obviously, we couldn’t make this list without Clark Griswald dragging his family to Wally World. While ‘Christmas Vacation’ is at the top of the series, this one still holds up as the all-time road-trip classic. It’s over-the-top, hilarious, and a staple of the genre.  Action in the movies is great, but it’s not as ideal while you’re on the road. Spare yourself any additional headaches with Good Sam Roadside Assistance.

At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.", "Edwin Hodge injects some diversity into the main cast as Malcolm Kingsley, a member of the wealthy Kinglsey family who underwrites the funding for the hospital. As the hospital's new head of finance, he also serves as a love interest for Sam, who is just getting over a previous relationship. Sam's team of doctors (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos, Michael Stahl-David) round out the secondary characters, most notably Marshall, who plays Dr. Lex Trulie, her best friend hiding a huge secret. Overall, Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly want to go on the ride Good Sam has in store for them. Families can talk about familial relationships. What do you think about the relationships in the series? What do you think is keeping the Griffith family from being closer? How does Sam demonstrate great leadership? How does Sam provide compassion and empathy to her patients and fellow doctors? Why does Sam feel unappreciated? How did she prove herself in the show? How should Sam's father, Dr. Rob Griffith, treat his daughter?  Research shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media.

Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "Filed under: Let’s round out the defensive coaches! Today will be the second of two days where we cover two of Tech’s new coaches.

Though his title is surely a mouthful, I think Turner is arguably the best hire Tech has made in the cycle. He joins Brent Key in having the title of Assistant Head Coach and will work opposite DB Coach Travares Tillman, who serves as the team’s Defensive Pass Game Coordinator.", "“I went into the game feeling game ready, but I would be lying if I sat here and told you that I wasn’t drinking Pepto Bismol in the (coaching) box because I had an ulcer,” Semore said, laughing. “And the guys, they executed above and beyond.” Semore also was in on the decision that promoted kicker Gavin Stewart, who responded by making all four of his field-goal tries against Pitt after Jude Kelley had struggled in Tech’s first four games. “A thing coach Key always says (is), we’re crazy if we keep doing the same things and expect different results,” Semore said. “It was just one of those things where we all felt comfortable with making that move at that point in time just to see. Let’s give some opportunities to some different guys.” One of those different guys was a ball coach named Jason Semore, who has made good on his chance.

On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "by Andy Demetra (The Voice of the Yellow Jackets) Inside The Chart On The Map: The upbringing that makes newly minted special teams coordinator Jason Semore unlike almost any coach in Division I football You’ve read this story before. Kid grows up a small-town coach’s son. Follows his dad into the business.  Grinds his way up the coaching ladder, establishing his own success. That doesn’t make Jason Semore all that different from the scores of other coaches’ sons who populate the staffs around college football. After playing for his dad in high school, then lettering in college, Semore has spent the past 17 years hopscotching from Division II to FCS to FBS, from one side of the country to the other, from small-school coordinator to Power-5 analyst and now, finally, to linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. On Monday he was promoted to the Yellow Jackets’ special teams coordinator, a role he also held in 2015 at the University of Montana.

Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of 2 million vehicles: “We’re aiming to achieve a 2 million vehicle run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a 1.5 million unit annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the 1.5 million mark, and will be exiting the year at a 2 million-unit run-rate,” Musk said. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has produced 3,429,532 cars.", "The company also said that the factory in Shanghai allows it to manufacture 750,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles a year. The production capacity of Tesla’s factory in California lets it annually make 100,000 more expensive Model S and Model X cars together with 550,000 of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The company’s Texas factory can produce 250,000 Model Y vehicles annually, and so can its factory in Germany. Tesla opened the new year by publishing its fourth-quarter vehicle production and 2022 delivery report on January 3, 2023. Total annual deliveries reached a new record of 1.31 million, increasing by 47% compared to the last year. Total annual production hit 1.37 million. The most popular vehicle of the year proved Model 3s, comprising over 95% of produced and delivered cars. The Q4 deliveries and production could have been more impressive. Their numbers fell short of analysts’ consensus, who expected Tesla to deliver around 427,000 cars. Contrary to analysts’ predictions, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles and produced 439,000 cars in the fourth quarter. The period ending December 31, 2022, was challenging for the company because of Covid outbreaks in China, leading to reduced production at its Shanghai factory. Yet Elon Musk sounded optimistic when he said he expected to achieve “50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.", "Tesla noted also: \"Annualized vehicle production run-rate of over 1.22 million in Q4-2021\" * The company doesn't break sales between the individual models. Model 3/Y Model S/X Cumulatively, Tesla sold over 2.3 million electric cars. Tesla repeats its expectation that the long-term average annual growth of vehicle deliveries will be at around 50%. 50% growth in 2022 would translate into 1.4 million - we guess that 1.5 million should be achievable. In the best-case scenario, it could be even more. By the end of 2022, there might be close to 4 million Tesla cars on the roads. \"We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain. Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022.\" Here is how quickly the company increased vehicle deliveries in the past (slowdown appears to be mostly related to lockdowns in 2020): More sales reports Trending Car Buying Service Get upfront price offers on local inventory.", "31, 2022, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 427,000 for the final quarter of the year. Estimates updated in December, and included in the FactSet consensus, ranged from 409,000 to 433,000. Those more recent estimates were in line with a company-compiled consensus distributed by Tesla investor relations Vice President Martin Viecha. That consensus, published by electric vehicle industry researcher @TroyTeslike, said that 24 sell-side analysts expected Tesla deliveries of about 417,957 on average for the quarter (and about 1.33 million deliveries for the full year). Tesla started production at two new factories this year — in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany — and ramped up production in Fremont, California, and in Shanghai, but it does not disclose production and delivery numbers by region.

Thank you to all of our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great year.       *************** Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q4 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.

This was at the height of the metaverse trend and would be the largest gaming industry deal in history. Microsoft is said to have wanted to acquire Activision Blizzard to further improve its presence in the gaming industry, and the metaverse, and to consolidate itself as the de facto king of cloud gaming.  With Activision’s titles under its umbrella and with Xbox and its Game Pass and XboX Live platforms to support it, few companies could challenge Microsoft in the gaming field. Acquiring Activision Blizzard gives Microsoft access to multi-million dollar IPs such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, and WarCraft franchises, as well as studios such as Treyarch and Infinity Ward, at a time when video game IP is proving highly valuable — just see the success of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation. The company would also become a major stakeholder in esports, and get access to esports leagues and platforms such as Major League Gaming, the Overwatch League, and the Call of Duty League. Couple all this with Activision Blizzard’s internal problems and affairs, and the fact that its CEO Bobby Kotick was investigated by the SEC, and one can see what makes the deal appealing to both sides.", "20][21] The timing of the acquisition was reported by The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News to be in response to the ongoing DFEH lawsuit. Reports from both newspapers stated that Activision Blizzard had been considering a buyout from other companies, including Facebook parent company Meta Platforms, due to the weaker than expected financial performance of their latest game releases and production delays.[22][23][24] Based on SEC filings related to the merger, Microsoft approached Activision Blizzard again in the days immediately following the November 2021 Wall Street Journal report regarding a buyout.[25] While Kotick had been hesitant about selling the company, the board had gone ahead with the deal as they continued to fear the ongoing impact of the lawsuit while Kotick remained on the board.[22][24] The buyout would provide a graceful exit for Kotick in the future, ranging in $252.2–292.9 million over most scenarios.[22][24][26]  According to official announcements, under the deal Kotick will remain the CEO of Activision Blizzard,[27][28][29][30] and is expected to keep the position while the deal goes through regulatory processes, as Activision Blizzard remains independent from Microsoft until the deal closes.[31] According to The Wall Street Journal, Kotick \"will depart once the deal closes\" under Microsoft's management, while Kotick said in an interview that he has an interest in remaining in the company.", "Through great teams and great technology, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard will empower players to enjoy the most-immersive franchises, like “Halo” and “Warcraft,” virtually anywhere they want.

The acquisition also bolsters Microsoft’s Game Pass portfolio with plans to launch Activision Blizzard games into Game Pass, which has reached a new milestone of over 25 million subscribers. With Activision Blizzard’s nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and three billion-dollar franchises, this acquisition will make Game Pass one of the most compelling and diverse lineups of gaming content in the industry. Upon close, Microsoft will have 30 internal game development studios, along with additional publishing and esports production capabilities. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of regulatory review and Activision Blizzard’s shareholder approval. The deal is expected to close in fiscal year 2023 and will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share upon close.

Simpson Thacher will serve as legal advisor for Microsoft while Skadden will serve as legal advisor for Activision.[11] The deal has been approved by both companies' board of directors and is expected to close in 2023 following international government regulatory review of the action.[12][13] Upon completion of the deal, Activision Blizzard would be a sibling entity to Xbox Game Studios under a new Microsoft Gaming division with Phil Spencer as its lead. The deal would also allow Microsoft to offer Activision Blizzard games on its Xbox Game Pass service.[13] Spencer also spoke about reviving some older Activision Blizzard franchises he himself enjoyed, mentioning series such as King's Quest, Guitar Hero and Hexen: Beyond Heretic.[14]  Kotick stated that he, Spencer, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella have had discussions in 2021 on their concern of the power of Tencent, NetEase, Apple, Inc.", "The FTC, after failing to obtain injunctions to block the merger, formally withdrew its challenge in July 2023, and the CMA subsequently agreed to put the case on hold to negotiate with both companies. The deal is now expected to close by October 18, 2023.  Activision Blizzard is one of the largest video game publishers in the world, with annual revenues of about $8.8 billion in 2021.[1] The company is composed of five business units:[2] Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, King,[3] Major League Gaming,[4] and Activision Blizzard Studios.[5][6] Among its assets are ownership of Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro from Activision's studios; Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment; and Candy Crush Saga from King.[7][8]  Microsoft is a dominant player in computing software, and also makes the Xbox line of game consoles and operates Xbox Game Studios, a collection of developers to create first party titles.

The 2022 edition of the Super Bowl, in which the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, was watched by more than 112.3 million viewers in the United States, according to Forbes. It was the highest-rated championship game since 2017.

A FOX Business analysis in 2020 marked out Honda, FedEx, Miller, Dodge, Toyota, Ford, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Budweiser as the companies that have spent the most over the years, with Budweiser spending $449.5 million on 135 ads across 53 Super Bowls.  The Super Bowl crossed the landmark $1 million mark in 1995, climbing to $2 million in the new millennium.

As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000. To put that into perspective, it cost roughly $233,000 per second for an ad in the 2022 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. Believe it or not, though, it’s money well spent for the advertisers—where else in the fragmented days of social media and streaming yanking away audiences (and their attention) will you get 100 million viewers…who are typically more interested in the ads than the actual game? And the costs work just as well for the network that airs the Super Bowl: a recent figure showed earnings of $434.5 million of in-game ad revenue.

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta “To gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that’s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,” Bjorlin continued. “This provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.” Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "At a virtual event this morning, Meta lifted the curtains on its efforts to develop in-house infrastructure for AI workloads, including generative AI like the type that underpins its recently launched ad design and creation tools. It was an attempt at a projection of strength from Meta, which historically has been slow to adopt AI-friendly hardware systems — hobbling its ability to keep pace with rivals such as Google and Microsoft. “Building our own [hardware] capabilities gives us control at every layer of the stack, from datacenter design to training frameworks,” Alexis Bjorlin, VP of Infrastructure at Meta, told TechCrunch. “This level of vertical integration is needed to push the boundaries of AI research at scale.” Over the past decade or so, Meta has spent billions of dollars recruiting top data scientists and building new kinds of AI, including AI that now powers the discovery engines, moderation filters and ad recommenders found throughout its apps and services. But the company has struggled to turn many of its more ambitious AI research innovations into products, particularly on the generative AI front. Until 2022, Meta largely ran its AI workloads using a combination of CPUs — which tend to be less efficient for those sorts of tasks than GPUs — and a custom chip designed for accelerating AI algorithms.", "Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min) Meta Unveils New AI Supercomputer Listen (2 min)  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

However, the exact date is not provided", "docs": ["Because New Orleans was supposed to host it, but a conflict with Mardi Gras forced them to push hosting back to 2025. The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton. She recently became the first Black artist to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album of the Year.  Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan performed the anthem in 2021.", "The Super Bowl will be the first big event scheduled for SoFi Stadium, with both the College Football Playoff Championship and WrestleMania 39 scheduled to take place there in 2023. The Chargers and Rams both began playing there in 2020, though fans weren't allowed at either of their home games as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. SoFi Stadium seats 70,240 people normally, but it can be expanded greatly for major events, including the Super Bowl, to seat up to 100,240. The stadium was originally expected to cost $2.5 billion to build, but because of the construction delays, it cost $5.5 billion, making it  the most expensive stadium ever built  .   The Rams will be the favorites for Super Bowl 56. They are technically the visitors at their home stadium — SoFi Stadium — but bookmakers evidently expect their defensive line to get pressure on Joe Burrow, who was the most sacked quarterback in the NFL during the 2021 NFL season. The NFL had previously announced that State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ari. — home of the Cardinals — would host the 2023 Super Bowl and the Caesar's Superdome — home of the Saints — would host the 2025 Super Bowl, but the league hadn't confirmed a host city for the 2024 event. Why?", "Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles (which declined to bid on Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.[20]  On May 18, 2017, authorities announced that the opening of Los Angeles's new stadium, SoFi Stadium, originally scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed a year to 2020. As a result, at the league's owners meetings in Chicago on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.[21]  The official logo for the game was unveiled on February 9, 2021, maintaining the standard design used since Super Bowl LI, but introducing sunset-themed[22] designs reflecting the landscape of the host city/nearby area (featuring in this case palm trees) within the traditional Roman numerals.[23]  In early January 2022, it was reported that AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was being considered as an alternate site for the game as a contingency plan due to an increase of COVID-19 infections in California attributed to the Omicron variant. The stadium last hosted Super Bowl XLV in 2011.", "One part of the partnership included that Roc Nation would take a big part in advising the league who they should choose for performances such as the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show will be the first for all artists aside from Blige’s appearance in 2001. Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don’t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL. The Bills (+1000), Ravens (+1400), and Browns (+1600) are the other preseason contenders in the AFC.", "Super Bowl 56 is now the only game left in the 2022 NFL playoffs. The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.

Players enter the world of Arkesia as young warriors, mages, martial artists, and magic-users, who’ve been chosen by prophecy to search for artifacts capable of saving the world from an awakening force of chaos. Upon its launch on Feb. 11, Lost Ark rapidly climbed Steam’s charts to hit an all-time peak of 1,325,305 players on Feb. 12, as shown by independent trackers like SteamDB. This is the second-highest number for concurrent players ever tracked on Steam, behind the record of 3.26 million that was set in 2018 by PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, and the highest number period for any MMORPG on Steam.

Lost Ark is primarily focused on player versus environment (PvE) and exploration (questing, achievement/collectible hunting, crafting, etc.). It features player versus player (PvP) elements as well.[7] Players start by customizing their character which they can then level up by completing the storyline.[8] Reaching level 50 unlocks access to tiered endgame dungeons and raids, at which point most further progress is tied to the character's gear score.  Lost Ark's development began in 2011[9] under the codename Project T.[10][11] The game uses Unreal Engine 3.[12] It originally only supported DirectX 9[13][14] but was updated to also support DirectX 11 prior to the western release in 2022.[15]", "Den of Geek    Ad Lost Ark is one of Steam's biggest hits in a long time, but what time will you be able to play the free-to-play version of the game?

The game quickly grew a sizeable fanbase in that region thanks to its PvP mechanics, extensive content offerings, cinematic style, and all those other MMO tropes that usually encourage people to gleefully spend a few hundred hours of their lives playing them.  So, while Lost Ark has been playable in South Korea and other regions for quite some time, those in the West who recently pre-ordered any of the Lost Ark Founder’s Pack on Steam were also able to start playing the game yesterday (February 8). You’re still able to start playing the game right now if you decide to buy a Founder’s Pack for the MMO via Steam (each of which comes with a variety of in-game rewards as well as early access to the title)."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Mickey put together a handpicked team of experts to simultaneously rob three big jewelry stores along Rodeo Drive during the Academy Awards when everyone was too distracted by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood’s elite to notice the elaborate heist unfold.    NBC’s newest foray into the heist TV drama genre is The Endgame which just recently premiered on the network. Starring Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathé, The Endgame follows Elena Federova, an international arms dealer and criminal mastermind who was recently captured by the FBI. Elena has orchestrated a number of bank heists all across New York and nobody knows why. But FBI agent Val Turner gets put on the case and might just be able to foil Elena’s ambitious plan and discover what her endgame is.    The only thing better than watching a heist unfold on a scripted TV show is watching it unfold knowing it’s completely based on real-life events.

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters.

It’s a densely woven series, with a number of enigmas and mysteries that it constantly keeps in the air. There’s no denying, though, that a major part of its appeal stems from James Spader’s scenery-chewing performance as the enigmatic yet compelling Reddington, and it remains one of his best roles.

The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return.

Therefore, I can't answer the question about the 2022 Winter Olympics", "docs": ["The 2022 Winter Olympics will give athletes from across the globe the chance to have their country’s national anthem played following their triumphs. If history is any indication, crowds expect to hear some songs on repeat. The Winter Olympics are often dominated by Europe with the United States and Canada in the mix throughout the competition. Countries that rose to the top of the podium at the first edition of the Winter Games in 1924 have traditionally stayed relevant to this day. Others had dominant periods before being merged or broken off into different countries all together. Between established European powers and two North American powerhouses, which nation has the highest medal count of all time? Here are the 10 countries with the most total medals in Winter Olympics history before the start of the 2022 Winter Games:  Total: 130 Gold: 45 Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC Silver: 44 Bronze: 41 Medals won in PyeongChang: 20 Sport with most medals: Speed skating (121) Dutch speed skaters famously take the ice wearing orange, but they often leave it wearing gold. The Netherland’s 121 speed skating medals are 37 more than any other country in the sport. The total is also nearly twice as much as the country’s haul in its top summer sport, swimming (62).", "Russia officially has 121 medals from 1994 through 2014, but the International Olympic Committee began stripping the nation of its medals earned during the 2014 Sochi Games. The number of medals the country has can change if any additional medals are stripped or reallocated by the IOC. In 2018, Russian athletes competed under the name Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and earned 17 medals. They will participate under the same designation in Beijing. The total sum of medals from these three eras would put the country in second place all-time on this list. Total: 232 Gold: 64 Silver: 81 Bronze: 87 Medals won in PyeongChang: 14 Sport with most medals: Alpine skiing (121) Austria has completely dominated alpine skiing throughout Winter Olympic history. Its 121 medals make up more than half of its entire medal haul (52.2%) and 26.2% of the medals ever handed out in the sport at the Olympics. Seven of the country’s 14 medals at the 2018 Games came in alpine skiing. The country brought its alpine skiing prowess to PyeongChang, tying Switzerland for first with seven medals in the sport. Austria also picked up three medals in luge, one in biathlon, one in Nordic combined and one in snowboarding.", "The nation has 20 or more total medals in three other sports: ski jumping (25), luge (22) and figure skating (20).  Total: 259 Gold: 100 Silver: 94 Bronze: 65 Medals won in PyeongChang: 31 Sport with most medals: Biathlon (52) Germany is one of just three countries to lead a Winter Olympics in medals four times (1992, 1998, 2002 and 2006). East Germany finished top two in the medal count at each Winter Olympics from 1972 through 1988 and led the 1980 Games with 23. Fast forward to 2018 and Germany put together an impressive performance in PyeongChang. Its 31 medals were second of any country and its 14 golds tied for first. Germany is the medals leader for two sports: biathlon and luge (37). Combined with East Germany (29), West Germany (10) and the United Team of Germany (5), it makes up 57.4% of the medals ever dished out in the sport’s history.", "The country has 18 alpine skiing medals -- including two golds from PyeongChang -- 16 speed skating medals, 14 biathlon medals, 11 ice hockey medals and 10 figure skating medals. Sweden took home seven gold medals from PyeongChang in 2018, good for sixth out of all participating countries. Their collection of 14 total medals tied for 10th. Total: 167 Gold: 43 Silver: 63 Bronze: 61 Medals won in PyeongChang: 6 Sport with most medals: Cross country skiing (80) Like Sweden, Finland’s top Winter Olympic sport is cross country skiing with 80 total medals. After cross country skiing, the country’s next-best sports are speed skating (24 total medals), ski jumping (22) and Nordic combined (14).  Finland had far and away the smallest haul from the 2018 Winter Olympics, winning just six total medals and only one gold. Four of the six medals, including the gold, came in cross-country skiing. A smaller collection is not uncommon for Finland despite their seventh-place spot on this list. It is the only country among the 10 included here that has never won 15 or more medals at a single Winter Olympics.", "The 32 medals won by Russian athletes mark the most medals ever won by Russian athletes in on Winter Olympics, regardless of representation. Host-nation China delivered its best Winter Olympics performance, scoring the third-most gold medals (9) but ranking 11th with 15 total medals. The nation's previous best total was 11 total medals, reached in both 2006 and 2010. For the United States, Nathan Chen, Jessie Diggins, Lindsey Jacobellis, Elana Meyers Taylor, and Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue all secured multiple medals. Jacobellis is the only athlete to win two gold medals.  After PyeongChang saw a Winter Olympics-record 30 different National Olympic Committees win medals, 29 different NOCs claimed at least one medal in Beijing. We've come a long way since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924, when 16 events across six sports were decided in Chamonix, France. *It should be noted that ROC's gold medal in the team figure skating event is provisional and dependent upon the adjudication of Kamila Valieva's doping case.

The film will be written by Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters director Tommy Wirkola. This will mark the seventh property that BOOM! has set up with Fox.

Comics. “Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters” writer-director Tommy Wirkola is writing the screenplay. McKay and Charles Randolph won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for “The Big Short.” Producers are Boom! Studios’ Ross Richie and Stephen Christy along with Gary Sanchez’s McKay and Kevin Messick. Adam Yoelin is a co-producer. Boom! has a first-look deal at Fox.            The comic-book, written by Mark Waid, was published between 2009 and 2012 for a total of 37 issues and centered on fallen superhero the Plutonian, who begins slaughtering the population of Earth. His former allies, the superhero group the Paradigm, attempt to find a way to stop his rampage but none of them are as powerful as the maniac holding the world hostage. The Paradigm then turns in desperation to a famous supervillain for help. McKay’s directing credits include “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” “Step Brothers,” “The Other Guys” and “Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.” Wirkola is repped by CAA, Principato-Young Entertainment and attorney Michael Schenkman.", "‘Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters’ writer-director Tommy Wirkola will pen the script.

However, it looks like his directing debut on a superhero film will be for an adaptation of the Mark Waid comic Irredeemable. According to Deadline, McKay has signed on to helm an adaptation of the book, which is about “the Plutonian, the world’s greatest superhero until he began heartlessly slaughtering the population of Earth, at least those who defy him. It falls to a superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage. They were former colleagues of the Plutonian, they’ve all got problems of their own, and none of them is nearly as powerful as the mass-murdering maniac holding the world hostage. In Clarice-Hannibal Lecter fashion, the Paradigm in desperation turns to a famous supervillain for help; it might be the only way to stop the carnage.” This sounds like a fun premise, and definitely swims in the darkness that McKay has shown he can handle with The Big Short.

This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "Here's a timeline of everything that has gone down between the two actors since the headline-making slap.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \tRania Aniftos   \tIt’s been almost a year since the slap heard around the world, when Will Smith stormed the stage at the Oscars on March 27, 2022, to smack Chris Rock across the face on live television.  \tThe tense moment occurred after Rock made an onstage joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, during the Academy Awards ceremony. “Jada, I love you. G.I Jane 2, can’t wait to see it,” the comedian said about her shaved head — which, unbeknownst to Rock, is caused by the actress’ struggles with alopecia.  \tPinkett Smith rolled her eyes in response, while Smith laughed. Shortly after, the King Richard actor ran up on stage to slap Rock, who attempted to continue his banter before Smith began shouting from his seat, “Keep my wife’s name out your f—ing mouth.”  \tIn the year since then, Smith has issued a number of apologies, others who were present at the situation have spoken up about what went down and Chris Rock has make jokes about the incident throughout his comedy specials.   \tWith the 2023 Oscars on the way, see below for a timeline of everything that has gone down between Smith and Rock since the slap.", "105] In the clips taken from a CBS Mornings interview, Carrey stated, \"You do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words\",[91] and that he would have sued Smith for $200 million if he were in Rock's position, saying, \"That video is going to be there forever. It's going to be ubiquitous. That insult is going to last a very long time.\" He further criticized the moral integrity of the Hollywood film industry for giving Smith a standing ovation after receiving his award.[106]  Anthony Hopkins, who presented the Academy Award for Best Actress, directly addressed Smith's behavior and Best Actor speech within his own speech, stating: \"Will Smith said it all. What more can be said? Let's have peace and love and quiet.\"[107]  Comedians, including George Wallace and Kathy Griffin, spoke out about how the incident had worried them about potential future confrontations, and that they might be more careful about the topics of jokes going forward.[108][109] Howie Mandel connected the Rock and Chappelle incidents, stating: \"That [slap] opened the floodgates. You saw what happened at the Academy Awards, and I thought that [...] violence triggers violence, and I think this is the beginning of the end for comedy\".[110]", "After the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it “does not condone violence of any form.” The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was aware of the incident. “The incident involved one individual slapping another,” the statement read. “The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.” “That was the greatest night in the history of television,” Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs — on stage to introduce a tribute to “The Godfather” — tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars afterparty. “Will and Chris, we’re going to solve that like family at the Gold party,” Combs said. The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few — if anyone — wanted to discuss. “I’m not talking about that,” said Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the director of “Summer of Soul,” which won an Oscar for best documentary. The confrontation overshadowed Smith’s milestone accomplishment."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

This guide highlights everything you need to know about the M2 chip, from performance improvements to extra features.    The M2 is Apple's next-generation System on a Chip (SoC) developed for use in Macs and iPads. It marks Apple's continued work to transition away from the Intel chips that were used in Macs up until 2020. As a \"System on a Chip,\" the M2 integrates several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more, all of which power the different features in the Mac. Before Apple silicon, Macs used multiple chips for CPU, I/O, and security, but Apple's effort to integrate these chips is the reason why the M2 is much faster and more efficient than Intel chips. The unified memory architecture that Apple has included is also a major factor because all of the technologies in the M2 are able to access the same data without having to swap between multiple pools of memory. Built into the M2 chip, the unified memory architecture means the CPU, GPU, and other processor components don't need to copy data between one another, and are able to access the same data pool."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board initially responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover, before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.  In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition.

Musk and Agrawal's depositions were originally scheduled for October 6 and 10, respectively.[142] Musk stated that his purchase of Twitter was part of his ambition to create an \"everything app\" called X, which would offer many different services.[143] In response, McCormick asked both sides to propose to her how they should proceed. Twitter shares surged by 23 percent as a result of Musk's announcement.[142] Neither Twitter nor Musk responded to McCormick's request, prompting her to announce that the trial would go forward as planned.[144]  On October 6, McCormick agreed to a request by Musk to postpone the trial to October 28 so Musk could finalize his debt financing for the acquisition, adding that the trial would be rescheduled to November if the deal did not close by then.", "30][31] The funding included $7 billion of senior secured bank loans; $6 billion in subordinated debt; $6.25 billion in bank loans to Musk personally, secured by $62.5 billion of his Tesla stock; $20 billion in cash equity from Musk, to be provided by sales of Tesla stock and other assets; and $7.1 billion in equity from 19 independent investors.[32][33][34]  The initially proposed $13 billion in money borrowed by Twitter is equivalent to seven times the company's 2022 projected operating cash flow; some banks found that multiple too risky and opted to participate only in the $12.5 billion margin loan to Musk.[35] The debt is estimated to cost Twitter approximately $1 billion in annual interest and fees.[30] Two days after announcing his bid, Musk registered three holding companies under the name \"X Holdings\" in preparation for his takeover.[36] Tesla shares fell 12 percent on the day after the acquisition was announced, amid smaller declines in the broader markets.

The Australian pushed the eventual champion hard after a Round 3 surge and had a hot start on Sunday with birdies on the first two holes which took him to just one behind Scheffler. But a triple bogey on the 12th after hitting into the water all but ended his chances at 'Amen Corner.' Smith, 28, had won two of four tournaments before Augusta and it looks like a Smith-Scheffler rivalry could develop into a fascinating contest this season. Lowry, meanwhile, will rue some missed chances after he played exceptionally well in the windy conditions on Friday and Saturday, but a 69 on Sunday was a strong finish.

Scheffler finished 10 under par for the tournament, in just his third Masters appearance. Rory McIlroy, who trailed Scheffler by 10 strokes heading into the final round, finished second after an eight-under-par 64. Smith and Shane Lowry tied for third, five strokes off the lead. Speaking with reporters after donning the ceremonial green jacket awarded to Masters winners, Scheffler talked of feeling calm on the course during the final round but said he was “so stressed out” on Sunday morning. “I cried like a baby,” he said. “I was so overwhelmed.” Scheffler added that he told his wife, Meredith, “I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Scheffler said he could not recall any previous episodes of self-doubt and attributed it to an understanding of how much winning the Masters would mean to him. “I’ve felt at peace on the golf course,” he said, laughing.", "17.

I think it was the most impossible Grand Slam for me to win, so I didn’t even think of it. When we came, I was just like, ‘Try to win a couple of matches.’ Now this happened. It’s crazy.” After being sidelined from April to October, she finished last season ranked just 99th.

Following the match, King greeted Vondrousova with a hug and told her: “First unseeded ever. I love it.” Centre Court’s retractable roof was closed for the final, shielding everyone from the wind that topped 20 mph (30 kph) outside, and that allowed Vondrousova’s smooth strokes to repeatedly find the intended mark.", "But Jabeur became the fifth seeded player to fall to the 24-year-old in this tournament as her unpredictability proved difficult for her opponents to overcome, with the Tunisian particularly struggling despite having numerous opportunities to take control of the match.           “Tennis is crazy,” said Vondroušová, a former junior No. 1 and runner-up at the 2019 French Open, in her on-court interview. “Yeah, I really don’t know what is happening now, it’s an amazing feeling.”           History would have been made no matter which of the finalists had lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish, but the enormity of the occasion weighed heavier on Jabeur, who has now lost a second successive Wimbledon final with this, she said after the defeat, being the most painful of her career. This was also her third loss in a major final.           But that is what pressure does to a player, especially one carrying the hopes of not only a nation but a continent while also trying to grapple with her own expectations, dreams and past failures. Jabeur again came close to becoming the first Arab and African woman to win a grand slam, but her 31 unforced errors proved costly and the wait goes on.

Djokovic didn't walk away with a trophy, but the 23-time Grand Slam champion was still able to add more achievements to his already impressive resume at Wimbledon. With his second-round victory against Jordan Thompson, Djokovic became one of only three players in tennis history with 350 wins in Grand Slam singles matches -- joining Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal.  After taking down No. 7 Andrey Rublev in Tuesday's quarterfinals, Djokovic reached a major semifinal for the 46th time in his career, tying Roger Federer's all-time men's record.  This year's Wimbledon has had headlines that are not all about the game.

And so Alcaraz managed to come through in that tiebreaker as choruses of “Car-los! Car-los!” from the stands competed with cries of his older, more experienced, more accomplished foe’s two-syllable nickname, “No-le! No-le!” And then Alcaraz came through in a 32-point, 25-minute masterpiece of a game soon thereafter. And, crucially, the Spaniard came through in the crucible of a fifth set, too. Add it all up, and the No. 1-ranked Alcaraz marked himself as the star people have been predicting he would be, transforming potential into triumph and putting an end to Djokovic’s 34-match winning streak at the All England Club all in one fell swoop by edging him 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 in an engaging, back-and-forth final on Sunday.

{"id": 67, "query": "Who is the new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022?", "ans": ["Brent Pry"], "label": [1], "prediction": "The new head coach of the Virginia Tech football team in 2022 is Brent Pry.", "docs": ["The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "Beamer remains extremely visible, often walking around campus engaging with fans and students. Pry has put himself out there as well in a bid to reignite a fan base that had grown weary amid losing records over the past few years. The Hokies finished below .500 in each of the previous two seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992, when Beamer was in the early stages of constructing the program. Almost immediately after his hiring, Pry seized upon the winning tradition Beamer had put in place over his Hall of Fame career, telling his charges during his first team meeting that they didn’t come to Virginia Tech to go 6-7. Players since have recalled that introduction to Pry as inspiration for this season and beyond. “That’s kind of the first thing that bridged the gap for us as players with a new coach,” wide receiver Kaleb Smith said. “Having somebody who knows the Virginia Tech traditions, knows what it means to be a Hokie — because that’s something we all share and hold deep in our hearts.” The unbridled enthusiasm Pry brings to the job surfaced during his opening remarks Thursday, when he paused to look at his cellphone and revealed Virginia Tech had just added another commitment. Pry, wearing a suit and tie in Hokies colors, then turned to the three players who accompanied him to the event and told them, “Virginia Tech just got better.", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "Follow A consensus outlook for the 2022 Senate elections based on the current ratings of these seven forecasters. For purposes of this map, only states rated safe by at least six of them are shown in the darkest shade.

Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction. As such, Verrilli aims to convince the U.S.", "While the emergence and growth of Web3-focused projects are notable, it’s also important to point out that current market conditions have been challenging for other key players. Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain — a cryptocurrency mining company — told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin miners raised equity in 2021, but this has become difficult for some, given the bear market.  “There are only two ways for miners to raise capital now, which is either through debt or by selling Bitcoin,” he said. Although this may be, Wall elaborated that only miners with a reputable track record will receive loans. “They need to be able to execute with clear plans, while not being over committed to machine purchases and bills they can’t pay.” Regulations were also heavily discussed at the conference. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as a number of key regulatory events took place leading up to the event. For example, the bipartisan crypto bill, also known as the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” was introduced in the United States Senate on June 7, 2022. According to a statement, the bipartisan bill sponsored by senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, “addresses CFTC and SEC jurisdiction, stablecoin regulation, banking, tax treatment of digital assets, and interagency coordination."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $17.659 billion in revenue and earnings of $2.26 per share. The expectations represent a massive year-over-year increase after Tesla achieved a new record for deliveries with over 310,000 deliveries during the quarter. Tesla released the results today and beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings with $18,756 billion in revenue and $3.22 per share (non-GAAP) during the first quarter of 2022. Tesla’s stock (TSLA) was up by as much as 4% in aftermarket trading after investors learned of the results. Here’s Tesla’s financial summary from the quarterly results (last quarter in red): The automaker managed to increase operating income to $3.6 billion during the quarter. Probably the most impressive metric is Tesla achieving 32.9% GAAP Automotive gross margin in the quarter. That’s despite supply chain issues and increasing costs, but Tesla has been known to quickly pass those customers with price increases and it is being reflected in its margins."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Hatch announced he would not seek reelection on Jan. 2, 2018, less than two weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed the tax bill that Hatch helped spearhead. “When the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter,” Hatch said in a statement announcing his retirement. “I’ve always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves.

Polls conducted after the debate to ascertain which candidate performed best, showed that 59% of viewers thought that Macron had performed better, compared to 39% for Le Pen.[74][75]  The trendlines below are constructed using local regressions.[76]      Macron was re-elected with 58.55% of the vote to 41.45% for Le Pen in the second round of the election.[77] Exit poll projections by Ipsos and Sopra Steria for France Télévisions and Radio France, released as voting closed, estimated that Macron defeated Le Pen with 58.2% of the vote to 41.8%.[78] He became the first French president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002.", "She is sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin and skeptical of NATO and the European Union. Le Pen conceded defeat in a speech to supporters shortly after the projections were released but said her unprecedented vote total represented “a shining victory in itself.” “The ideas we represent are reaching summits,” she said. After polls closed across France at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the polling companies Opinionway, Harris and IFOP worked with media organizations to publish projected results based on early voting patterns. The interior ministry announced the final results Monday, with Macron winning 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5 percent. The campaign was beset by apathy, with many voters dissatisfied with both candidates and the turnout looking likely to be around 2 points lower than it was five years ago.  Politicians across the political spectrum will also likely reflect on the huge number of abstentions, which reached a record 28 percent of the electorate. But ultimately Macron, 44, has won a clear victory that surpassed his polling numbers, surging in the final stages to earn five more years at the helm of one of the continent's two major powers. He will become the first president since Jacques Chirac two decades ago to secure a second term in office but must now confront domestic dissatisfaction, as well as the effects of both the Covid-19 pandemic and the war on the continent.", "Le Pen called her result “a shining victory,” saying that “in this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope.”  Breaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac. She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.", "“This will be my responsibility.” At Le Pen’s election night event, at a Parisian park pavilion, the release of projected results provoked a mix of boos and solemn silence. But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "79][80][81] The projections, based on actual ballot papers, also showed that 28% of registered voters did not show up to the second round,[82] making it the lowest turnout since 1969.[83] Official results showed that the turnout was 71.99%, with over 13 million abstentions in the second round, in addition to over 8.6% of ballots cast being blank or invalid (a marked increase over the first round).[77]  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's first round map  Map of which candidate placed second in every department during the first round  2022 French presidential election's first round in Petite Couronne by commune  Results of the first round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the first round by municipality  First-place candidate by country (Overseas French) during the first round  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's second round map  Results of the second round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the second round by municipality  The New York Times commented that the race was much closer than in 2017, when Macron won 66.1% of the vote to Le Pen's 33.9%, but that Macron's margin was wider than expected prior to the election.[85] Le Pen conceded defeat minutes after the estimated results were released,[83] but still called the outcome a victory for her political movement and for the upcoming parliamentary elections."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Every group of this mosaic of ‘sub-pixels’ can be combined with smart algorithms to form color information, yielding a color image. All but one of the iPhone 14 Pro’s sensors look like this: Every ‘pixel’ essentially being composed of one blue, one red and two green subpixels. The iPhone 14 Pro’s main camera, however, puts four times as many pixels in that same space: You might be wondering why, exactly, it would not squeeze in four times as many pixels in an equally ‘mosaicked’ pattern, instead opting for this four-by-four pattern known as ‘Quad Bayer’.  While we can dedicate an entire post to the details of camera sensors, allow me to briefly explain the benefits. Apple has a few main desires when it comes to its camera. Resolution was not the only reason to move to a more advanced, larger and higher pixel-count sensor. Apple desires speed, low noise, light gathering ability, dynamic range (that is, detail in both shadow and light areas) and many more things from this sensor.  As we mentioned before, algorithms are required to ‘de-mosaic’ this color information. In terms of sheer speed, a Quad Bayer sensor can quickly combine these four ‘super subpixels’ of single color into one, creating a regular 12 megapixel image.", "Apple did not go into great detail about the camera hardware changes here, but thankfully Techinsights took the entire camera package apart. The new sensor, at 40mm², is almost 50% larger than the iPhone 13 Pro’s 26.9 mm² sensor. While its aperture is slightly ‘slower’ (that is, smaller) the larger sensor compensates. How does the sensor and lens change stack up in practice? The iPhone 14 Pro easily outperforms the previous iPhone, creating far sharper shots: In multiple shots in various conditions, the shots were far more detailed and exhibited less visible processing than comparable iPhone 13 Pro shots: A nice side benefit of a larger sensor is a bit more shallow depth of field. At a 13mm full-frame equivalent, you really can’t expect too much subject separation, but this shot shows some nice blurry figures in the background.  I believe that both Apple’s new Photonic Engine and the larger sensor are contributing to a lot more detail in the frame, which makes a cropped image like the above shot possible. The ‘my point of view’ perspective that the ultra-wide provides puts you in the action, and a lack of detail makes every shot less immersive.  Is it all perfect? Well, comparably, with the main camera getting ever-better, it is still fairly soft and lacking detail. Its 12 megapixel resolution is suddenly feeling almost restrictive.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Lux  When the iPhone was first introduced, it packed in quite a few innovations. At a now-legendary keynote, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was launching a widescreen iPod, a phone and an internet communications device. These three devices were not separate new products, he revealed — they were all functions of a revolutionary new device: the iPhone. If introduced today, we’d find a conspicuous absence in that lineup: a groundbreaking new camera. It was not one of the devices he mentioned, and for good reason: The iPhone launched with a 2-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter. There was no pretense about this replacing your camera for taking photos.  Fast forward to today, and the main feature-point of most smartphone launches is, of course, their cameras. Plural. In the time since the iPhone launched, it has gone through small steps and big leaps and from a single fixed-focus camera to an entire complex array of cameras.  Evolution. #iPhone14 pic.twitter.com/8A7JUTQdcl With iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made a huge change to its entire camera system — and yet, it seems many reviewers and publications cannot agree on whether it is a small step or a huge leap.  At Lux, we make a camera app. We have been taking thousands of iPhone photos every month since we launched our app five years ago, and we know a thing or two about smartphone cameras.", "This is our deep dive into iPhone 14 Pro — not the phone, the iPod, or the internet communicator — but the camera.  We previously took a look at the technical readout of the iPhone 14 Pro, offering us a chance to look at the camera hardware changes. Our key takeaway was that there are indeed some major changes, even if just on paper. The rear camera bump is almost all-new: the iPhone 14 Pro gains larger sensors in its ultra-wide and main (wide) cameras, but Apple also promises leaps in image quality through improved software processing and special silicon. However, what caught everyone’s eye first was the opener of Apple’s presentation of iPhone 14 Pro: a striking visual change. The iPhone’s recognizable screen cutout or ‘notch’ had all but disappeared, tucking its camera and sensor hardware into a small yet dynamic ‘island’. The user interface adapts around it; growing and shrinking with the screen cutout in an absolute feat of design. What’s more impressive to us, however, was miniaturizing the complex and large array of sensors and camera needed for Face ID. While the large cameras protruding ever-further from the rear of our iPhones capture our attention first — and will certainly get the most attention in this review, as well — the front-facing camera in the iPhone 14 Pro saw one of the biggest upgrades in recent memory, with its sensor, lens and software processing seeing a significant overhaul."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits.

The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Let’s check out everything there is to know about Overwatch 2 including its 5v5 switch, tank changes, maps, heroes & more. Overwatch has become one of the globe’s most beloved FPS titles. Packed to the brim with awesome characters, beautiful maps, and accompanied by a vibrant esports scene, Blizzard’s flagship FPS has cemented its place in gaming history. Therefore, when it was announced at Blizzcon 2019 that there was going to be a sequel, fans went wild. While it’s been a long journey to the eventual release, pieces are finally starting to fall into place. From a release date to a look at the new heroes, here’s everything we know about Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 is set to launch on Tuesday, October 4. However, it’s worth noting that this initial launch will be focused entirely on PvP and come with the ‘early access’ label. Since the game’s announcement, Blizzard had been fairly tight-lipped regarding a concrete launch date. That was, up until confirmation arrived during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase 2022 event. Even with an initial release now locked in, the exact rollout is still muddled.", "The company plans to share more about Overwatch 2 in a “reveal event” livestream that takes place in just a few days — you can watch it on June 16th at 1PM ET. Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2 in 2019, but it really only began showing the game in earnest over the past few months, including with a closed beta. The company has split the development of the PVP and PVE parts of the game. While the PVP element will be available October 4, we still don’t know when the PVE portion will be available.

As a sequel and replacement to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while initially having plans for introducing persistent cooperative modes, though the plans were later scrapped in 2023, focusing the game on its PvP elements. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked. Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.  Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.  The original Overwatch was designed for six-on-six team combat, with two of each class on a team.", "Overwatch 2.

I have no idea,” former game director Jeff Kaplan said at the reveal panel when asked when the game would arrive. “Like, just let us make it great, that’s what we care about more than anything. We don’t have a date in mind.” Back then, it was largely assumed the game would land in 2021 – there was a playable vertical slice at BlizzCon 2019, after all – but recent events within Activision Blizzard eliminated any chance of the game launching soon. In a February 2021 financial call Activision Blizzard CFO, Dennis Durkin, said the company’s outlook “does not include” Overwatch 2 releasing in 2021.", "All you need to know about the arrival of Overwatch 2.

{"id": 83, "query": "Who won the 2022 Tour de France?", "ans": ["Jonas Vingegaard"], "label": [0], "prediction": "Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) won the 2022 Tour de France.", "docs": ["Although the race came back together before the finish, what was maybe most notable was that Vingegaard was part of the small first group over the climb, while teammate and co-leader Primož Roglič wasn’t.  Maybe Roglič (correctly) bet the race would come back together and it wasn’t a wise use of strength. But after he seemed slightly less fit on climbs than Vingegaard at June’s Criterium du Dauphiné, the fact that he wasn’t present at a crucial moment will do little to settle the debate about which rider is the team’s best shot at yellow. Elsewhere, Ineos was clearly the most watchful of the GC teams, with Yates, Geraint Thomas, and Dani Martinez attentive at the front. There’s a lot of race left in the Tour but we may look back on today’s events as a predictor of what was to come. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) remained the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France after finishing second on Stage 3 in Sønderborg. The 27-year-old actually extended his lead by earning a 6-second time bonus on the finish line. The Netherland’s Dylan Groenewegen (Team BikeExchange-Jayco) won the stage, his first Tour stage win since 2019.", "Pogačar vowed to keep fighting, and he kept his word. But Vingegaard responded quickly to each new assault, never faltering as the riders battled intense heat through the Massif Central. In the end it came down the Pyrenees, where Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates, each depleted due to the loss of key teammates, traded blows in the mountains. Again Vingeggard waited, following each of Pogačar’s accelerations with ease. He delivered the coup de grace at the end of Stage 18 on the climb to Hautacam, the Tour’s last summit finish. Pulling away from Pogačar with about 4km left to climb, Vingegaard won the stage to put the Tour out of reach before Saturday’s time trial. Not leaving anything to chance, he still finished second in the race against the clock on Stage 20, confirming once and for all that the strongest rider won the 2022 Tour de France. Pogačar isn’t going home empty-handed: in addition to finishing second overall, the 23-year-old won the white jersey as the Tour’s Best Young Rider and three stages during the Tour’s first week. But more importantly, he learned valuable lessons about how to better gauge his efforts during a Grand Tour.", "Pogačar remains the best all-around rider in the world, and with a little more tactical nous–and perhaps a bit more humility–he might get even better. Who Really Won the Tour? While INEOS-Grenadiers finished the Tour atop the Team’s Classification, Jumbo-Visma was the best team in the 2022 Tour de France. In addition to winning the yellow jersey, Vingegaard also won the polka dot jersey as the winner of the Tour’s King of the Mountains competition. His teammate, Belgium’s Wout van Aert, won the green jersey as the winner of the Tour’s Points Classification and was also named the Tour’s Most Aggressive Rider. Along the way the team won six stages: three with van Aert, two with Vingegaard, and one with France’s Cristophe Laporte. Perhaps even more impressive was the manner in which the team defended Vingegaard’s lead in the Pyrenees during the Tour’s third week. The team lost Slovenia’s Primož Roglič and the Netherlands’ Steven Kruijswijk on Stage 15, with Roglič not taking the start and Kruijswijk crashing out on the road to Carcassonne.", "With three days left in the 2022 Tour de France, Vingegaard looks assured of standing on the top step of the podium in Paris. Barring a crash, a mechanical, or a terrible ride in Saturday’s 40km individual time trial, the Dane’s lead is too much for Pogačar to overcome. Pogačar and Thomas look certain to stand next to Vingegaard on the Tour’s final podium. Thomas is one the Tour’s better time trialists, and there’s little chance of Gaudu overtaking him. By winning the Tour’s final summit finish atop the Hors Categorie climb to Hautacam, Vingegaard also took the lead in the Tour’s King of Mountains competition. He won’t get a chance to wear the polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification, but with only three Category 4 climbs left in the race, he’s assured of taking the prize. In the end, Stage 18 capped a legendary team performance for Jumbo-Visma, who looks set to go home with the yellow, green, and polka dot jerseys and at least four stage wins. And with two more stages expected to end in sprints and a long time trial on Saturday–all of which suit van Aert–the team’s tally could increase. Who’s Winning the Tour?", "The Tour now takes a day off to travel back to France, with van Aert leading the Tour’s General Classification by 7 seconds over Belgium’s Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl) and 14 seconds over Slovenia’s Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates). The next three stages suit the Belgian’s talents, so there’s a good chance that he’ll hold the Tour’s yellow jersey for a few more days. Who’s really winning the Tour? A relatively peaceful stage was interrupted by a large crash with about 10km to-go, emphasizing how important it is to stay as close to the front as possible at the end of these early stages.  Luckily, most of the Tour’s GC contenders managed to avoid losing time, with the exception of Colombia’s Rigoberto Uran (EF Education-EasyPost), who was held up by a crash for the second day in row and this time was unable to rejoin the leaders. The 35-year-old lost 39 seconds by the finish, a tough blow to his chances of scoring a high finish in Paris. Who’s Winning the Tour? Belgium’s Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) is the new overall leader of the 2022 Tour de France."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

EPS rose 8.6% compared with the year-ago quarter, the slowest rise since the company's earnings declined in the final quarter of FY 2020. Apple’s EPS and revenue have been going up year-on-year (YOY) every quarter since Q4 FY 2020 but at a slowing rate.   The company’s focus has shifted over the years to focus more on the services and subscriptions it offers. In Apple’s revenue report, it divides its sales by physical products and services offered. Apple continues to see the sale of software, services, and subscriptions increase while some of the revenue from physical products is decreasing over time.   Source: Visible Alpha   Investors should continue to focus on Apple’s services as a key metric. Its services include the company's digital content stores and streaming services, such as its various App Store platforms, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Fitness+. Apple also generates services revenue from AppleCare, advertising services, cloud services, and other services, including Apple Card and Apple Pay.   It's more economical to build up a services business than to release newer iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, or other physical products. Services revenue continues to outpace Apple’s product revenue. Analysts expect the company to generate $79.8 billion in services revenue for this fiscal year, up 16.6% compared with the previous year.", "Focus on Apple's Services Revenue  Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics.

At IGN's \"Best of 2022\" awards, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 won the category of \"Best RPG\".[47]", "Completing Future Redeemed unlocks an additional challenge battle, through which the player can earn Shulk and Rex as heroes in the main game.[10]  The first ideas for the plot of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came during the development of the second entry of the three games, Xenoblade Chronicles 2. According to Tetsuya Takahashi, creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, the Mechonis sword featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles and the Titan of Uraya featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is what sparked the idea of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Bringing the two worlds together, the broken sword of the Mechonis going through the wounded Titan of Uraya is the visual key of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, indicating war between the two worlds, thus the starting idea for this game.[11] In May 2018, Takahashi pitched Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group of Monolith Soft, known for their work on the Xenoblade Chronicles series, started development on the game in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country went gold.[12]", "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was received positively by critics, who praised its story, themes, gameplay, music, characters, and scale, but criticized its technical and graphical issues at launch. The game had sold 1.86 million copies by March 2023. An expansion taking place before the events of the game, Future Redeemed, was released in April 2023.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in Aionios, where two warring nations, Keves and Agnus, engage in perpetual war fought by soldiers with ten-year lifespans.  The story follows Noah and his two childhood friends, Eunie and Lanz, who are from Keves, and Mio and her two fellow servicemen, Sena and Taion, who are from Agnus.

But it's important to note that", "docs": ["Who's the main villain of the movie? Who dies? Are the horses ok!? Beloved writer-director Jordan Peele added his long-awaited third film, Nope, to his collection on July 22. It is a sci-fi horror film that takes both of those genres to completely new and unprecedented places. Peele said about the film, “It’s a bigger adventure than I’ve ever tried to tell. From a film perspective, by far my most ambitious.” Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, the two created the first horror film to be shown on IMAX cameras. In typical Peele fashion, Nope has induced awe into fans old and new, diverted and exceeded viewers’ expectations, and taken over the current cultural discourse, creating a slew of new conversations to be had about film and our relationship with it. While Nope hit theaters on July 22, it is currently streaming at home, exclusively on Peacock, having made its way to the NBC-owned streamer on November 18th. If you are more old-skool about your media, you can buy Nope on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD, with extras including a making of documentary, gag reels, deleted scenes, a deep dive into \"The Horse in Motion\" short film, and more.", "SEARCH “Nope” takes many liberties with the history of “the first motion picture,” but Jordan Peele’s latest film illustrates how Black contributions are often marginalized. Entertainment Reporter The story behind The Horse in Motion—the so-called “first motion picture”—has almost as many twists and turns as Nope, Jordan Peele’s latest horror romp that references the series of cabinet cards showing a man riding a horse. Nope stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as OJ and Emerald Haywood, two siblings who rent out horses for Hollywood productions. During a pitch to a crew, Emerald reveals she and her brother are descendants of one “Alistair E. Haywood,” the Black jockey who appears in what Emerald calls the very first movie. This backstory comes full circle when the Haywoods take it upon themselves to capture another fast and unwieldy subject: a voracious UFO. Theirs is a mythical course-correction, with Peele giving kudos to the unidentified Black jockey whose likeness is immortalized as part of the early history of motion pictures. In the movie, his great-great-great grandchildren are struggling to keep the family business afloat despite being part of what should be Hollywood royalty. Like any work of fiction, Nope took more than a few liberties with the story of The Horse in Motion.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown. He sits alongside the many other male athletes, women mimicking housework and children in Muybridge’s oeuvre: an anonymous cast of characters from early film history.", "Advertisement Supported by Is the rider in the 19th-century photographic experiments really unknown, as Jordan Peele’s film implies? It’s complicated. By Ben Kenigsberg Near the beginning of “Nope,” Emerald (Keke Palmer), who with her brother, Otis Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya), runs an animal-wrangling service for Hollywood shoots, delivers a pitch on a set. (If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve heard the abridged version.) She cites a milestone in the development of cinema: a famous series of sequential photographs from the 19th century depicting a horse in motion. Emerald suggests that the crew members she is addressing will know the name of the man who captured those images, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge. But they won’t be able to name the jockey riding the horse. That pioneering actor and stunt man, Emerald says, was her great-great-great grandfather. That last part is a bit of invention by the writer-director, Jordan Peele. His point is that the identity of the Black horse rider is probably unknown, and that from the start of movies, the camera — with its power to see — has also left certain people, and certain stories, unseen.", "(Keith David), killed in a freak accident in which debris rained down from the sky, they’re running into hard times. Plus, the advent of CGI means the movies just don’t require real horses on set the way they used to. Alistair Haywood’s character is Peele’s invention, though the film in which he rode a horse, made by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, is real. Actually, there were multiple films; the one that Peele intertwines Nope with involves a horse named Annie G. ridden by an unidentified but definitely Black jockey. History remembers the horse but has lost track of the jockey’s identity, which is sort of Nope’s point. In one scene, Emerald proudly announces on a movie set that “since the moment pictures could move, we got skin in the game.” But nobody remembers Haywood unless she reminds them. In any case, the Haywood ranch is just up the road from Jupiter’s Claim, and OJ’s been selling horses to owner Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun) to keep the ranch afloat. Jupiter’s Claim is a goofy cartoonish amusement park lightly modeled on a fun-loving town from some old Western — and those in turn, let’s remember, were very lightly modeled on the actual West."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The game will be played at a specially constructed park built near the field from the iconic 1989 movie starring Kevin Costner. Costner plays an Iowa farmer who plows over his corn to build a baseball field for Joe Jackson and other members of the banished Chicago White Sox to play on. Iowans got a chance to purchase tickets to last year's game as well through a special lottery.

Three people told CNN Business that they feel that “full self-driving” is worth the high price to them because they personally relish testing new technologies and are excited about the promise of what “full self-driving” might eventually become.            “I really admire the optimism of all these people,” Brian Moody, executive editor of the online car marketplace AutoTrader.com, said of those who believe “full self-driving” may soon handle all driving responsibilities despite years of delays. “I wish I could be that way.”            Moody told CNN Business that “full self-driving” is especially expensive compared to other available driver-assist packages like GM’s SuperCruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist. SuperCruise generally costs about $2,500 – plus a monthly $25 connectivity fee after the third year – and ProPilot Assist can be under $2,000 in some cases.", "[1/4]A Tesla Model S charges at a Tesla supercharger station in Cabazon, California, U.S. May 18, 2016.  REUTERS/Sam Mircovich Tesla released FSD Beta to nearly all of its 400,000 FSD customers in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter, when it recognized FSD revenue of $324 million. It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA said on Thursday despite the FSD recall its \"investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.\" Tesla said in \"certain rare circumstances ... the feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers.", "But when Tesla started rolling out the FSD beta to a select group of customers in October 2020, it upped the price to $10,000. In September 2021, Tesla began opening the beta to more customers via a new “request” button before increasing the price to $12,000 earlier this year. In 2019, Musk called Tesla vehicles “appreciating assets,” meaning that they’ll increase in value as Tesla launches additional driver-assist features. Musk later claimed that “the value of FSD” could reach over $100,000 “as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval.” Earlier this month, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of making “untrue or misleading claims” about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. The DMV alleges that the names Autopilot and FSD, as well as the language Tesla uses to describe them, could deceive users into thinking that the vehicles can operate autonomously.  Last August, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the way Tesla advertises its FSD and Autopilot software. The two lawmakers later sent a letter to Musk to “express significant concerns” over Tesla’s driver-assist system, which Tesla responded to by saying its system can help customers “drive safer than the average driver in the U.S."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

NBC launched GolfPass with McIlroy in 2019, two years before McCarley left the network. “It evolved into how we can harness technology to enhance the experience for both participants who play and for fans,” McCarley said. “We believe there is a difference between following and watching -- so shorter-form experiences are going to be more important as we continue to be crunched for time.” MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS: McCarley bounced the idea off his mentor, Ebersol, who immediately bought into the idea and helped McCarley refine the concept.", "Combating some of the riches on offer might be a harder, more long-term prospect but this intervention from the two biggest names in golf will at least neuter one of LIV’s arguments.

However, Colorado is expected to be dreadfully bad this year, according to the college football win totals market. As talented as Hunter is, it’s hard to see the Heisman Trophy awarded to a player on a four-win team, no matter how talented that player might be. That leaves Perkins, who will terrorize SEC quarterbacks and protection schemes this fall. Perkins will compete directly against his quarterback, Jayden Daniels, in the Heisman market. And if Daniels is even remotely good, that will all but eliminate Perkins from contention.  For Perkins to remain relevant for the Heisman Trophy, Daniels must either struggle this year or get hurt and miss several games.", "Further below, you can find an early look at our 2023 Heisman candidates.

Under Kombouaré the club had lost ten matches in a row, leading him to be dismissed and replaced by Denis Zanko.[7] On 30 April that year, Toulouse were relegated to Ligue 2 after the LFP elected to end the season early due to the coronavirus pandemic.[8]  On 21 July 2020, RedBird Capital Partners acquired an 85% stake in Toulouse FC.[9] The club achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 by winning the second tier, Ligue 2, in 2022.[10] On 29 April 2023, Toulouse won its first-ever Coupe de France title, defeating Kombouaré's Nantes in the final by a score of 5–1.[11]", "“But we’ll have no inferiority complex attacking Ligue 1, and by ‘attack’ I mean on the pitch and psychologically,” says Comolli, a former sporting director at Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. “We are as good as the others. You’ll not hear me, the head coach or the players — from the youth section to the senior and women’s teams — saying our target is merely ‘to stay up’. “For us, always, the sky is the limit.” Toulouse benefited from some time to prepare for promotion. Montanier and his players built up a head of steam as last season reached its halfway point and were in the division’s top two since the third round of games.  Yet, even with the benefit of bonus breathing space, their planning in the new year had to take into account the fact they would be fighting at a disadvantage from the outset at the higher level. The distribution of television rights money in France leans heavily on a team’s performances over the preceding five years, a period in which they finished 18th, 16th and 20th in the top division before their two-season stint in the second tier.

The current playing staff pass the original, rather weather-beaten mural for France ’98 as they arrive at the ground — as many on bicycles or e-scooters as driving 4x4s — for training every day. The club’s academy, situated next to the stadium, was placed in the top five of 36 similar institutions in the country last year by the French Football Federation (FFF) and has a long and proud history of producing players who have thrived in senior football at Toulouse and beyond. The fact that Olivier Sadran, a local businessman who had bought his local team in 2001, was keen to retain a 15 per cent shareholding offered a nod to continuity and reassured any locals wary of outside investment. Comolli, born around 100 miles to the east in Beziers, recognised the club’s potential.

RedBird, founded by Gerald Cardinale in 2014 and whose interests include a $750million (£634.2m) stake in Fenway Sports Group — the owners of Liverpool, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Boston Red Sox — had been exploring the European football market for potential investment opportunities for several years.

They visited at least 50 of them over four years to gather information. Comolli, who had recently left Fenerbahce, was presented with that hefty dossier when meeting members of the group around the Super Bowl in Miami early in 2020. One of those listed was Toulouse. The Americans were seeking to buy a club in a dynamic city — economically and demographically — that was blessed with solid facilities, a thriving academy and a local partner with whom they could work. “Le TeFeCe” met all those criteria.", "Olivier Jaubert, formerly with Nike and the FFF, runs the commercial and business side of the club, with Comolli overseeing the football operation.

The fund will add AC Milan to its roster early next month, has also taken a stake in the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals and owns 50 per cent of Zelus Analytics, a sports data business whose input shapes Toulouse’s transfer policy. The club have gladly tapped into their owners’ expertise in the fields of merchandise, media and sport, with the chain of decision-making slick and efficient. RedBird representatives, initially frustrated by COVID-19 restrictions, have visited Toulouse two or three times since their purchase but there is a company business call once a fortnight, and a weekly football club call. “The operation needs to be self-sustainable, and we are,” adds the club president. “We were even in Ligue 2. We are making money. The owners couldn’t believe that, but last year we made money — a significant profit. “Now the ambition is to improve the facilities.

However, it mentions that the album is already released, so it can be inferred that the release date is before the time the document was written.", "docs": ["Carousel of Time is a Joni tribute album, and while I myself am only familiar (fully) with songs like ‘Both Sides Now’ and ‘River’, I’ve since heard Jackie’s interpretation of songs like ‘Circle Game’ and ‘A Case of You’, and I’m reminded, of the timelessness of these songs, how songs from yesteryear can be covered and redone to create a sense of freshness that these songs would only have had, if it was covered and unveiled to a new generation of people, as a reminder that songs from yesteryear still have a place in current society. While it’s still not known when Jackie’s own original material is releasing to the public (as said in her most recent interview with Yahoo- she doesn’t know when she’s unveiling her original songs, but still under the impression that it’s coming out soon), Carousel of Time can hopefully tie us over until then. While the album unfortunately doesn’t have ‘Big Yellow Taxi’ (a song that I reckon, is Joni’s biggest radio hit), these 10 tracks still convey Joni’s own impact and influence on music, full stop. While Jackie’s been out for some time, it’s great that she’s able to return, and to return with a Joni tribute album, is one of the best ways to make a splash back into the music industry.", "Copyright ©  The Recap Group. All rights reserved. TALENTRECAP.COM  Talent  America's Got Talent Jackie Evancho has released a new album called Carousel of Time. The project contains 10 gorgeous covers of songs originally by legendary singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell. This album shows just how much Evancho has matured as an artist since she appeared on America’s Got Talent. It’s appropriate that Evancho chose Carousel of Time as the title of this album. The phrase comes from a lyric in Mitchell’s song “The Circle Game,” which is all about growing up and looking back at where we came from. In 2010, Evancho finished AGT in second place at the age of 10. Now 22, the singer is finding her voice as an adult in the music industry. That voice, as we’ve come to expect, is absolutely beautiful. Evancho brings a signature ethereal quality to Mitchell’s music, as well as a clear emotional connection with the lyrics. In addition to the nostalgic “Circle Game,” other highlights from the album include the bittersweet opening track, “Both Sides Now,” as well as the soaring “A Case of You” and the melancholy “River.” The project is likely to serve as a captivating introduction to Mitchell’s music for a younger generation.", "Carousel of Time is the ninth studio album from classical crossover singer Jackie Evancho. What’s especially impressive is that Evancho is only twenty-two years old! She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well. (Melody Place)       Robert J.", "Yes, Jackie started to have fame when she wasn’t even a teenager, and now at age 22, has been battling eating disorders for a while now. But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4.", "SEE ALSO: JACKIE EVANCHO CONTINUES HER COMEBACK WITH ANOTHER JONI MITCHELL COVER Evancho recently chatted with Talent Recap about the new project, saying that Mitchell is an artist she’s “been very inspired by for a very long time.” She added that something she loves about Mitchell is that she’s “so authentic.” “You know, even for the time period, she did not care what anyone said, as long as she was content with the music,” Evancho shared. “So I think it’s appropriate for the point in my life that I’m going through, and I’m excited to see what everyone thinks of it.” Evancho also shared that she’s “been doing a lot of songwriting,” confirming that fans can expect another album of original songs at some point. As she said, “I will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.” The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie’s incredible, ethereal voice.  Carousel of Time is now and will be remembered as one of her best gifts to the world. Thank you, Jackie.

It’s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.” Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis’s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. “Leonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,” Mancano said. “That’s how he’s lived his life. So he’s going to do whatever he can to try to get what he needs, and it wouldn’t surprise me, in fact, if he wasn’t planning [his escape] for a long time.", "His flight also triggered new calls from attorneys representing Navy officers in related cases for more details about the health issues that caused Francis to be released from prison on a medical furlough that the court repeatedly extended without objection from prosecutors. Francis pleaded guilty in 2015 and became a cooperating witness. He spent a couple of years in prison before a diagnosis of kidney cancer led to his initial furlough in 2018 for medical treatment, and then multiple extensions, court files show. With Francis’s help, prosecutors secured convictions of 33 of 34 defendants. Francis increasingly took advantage of his confinement rules, according to new records on his household arrangements obtained by The Washington Post and interviews with people who knew or worked for him during his years in home detention. He hired servants to meet his family’s every need and undermined the court’s security requirements aimed at keeping him from fleeing  by stationing his personal security guards in windowless garages, with no night patrols and no visitor’s logs. He seemed able to anticipate when federal officers were headed to check on him, the interviews showed, and allowed a video crew to film him days before he fled. During his  years on medical furlough, Francis stayed at three private homes, where his comforts and liberties grew. Most recently he, his family and an English bulldog lived in a five-bedroom, seven-bath home with a $7,000-a-month rent in a gated community, court filings and interviews show.", "In return, many of the beneficiaries helped Francis by giving him information on ship movements or pending Navy contracts, running interference against ship-servicing companies competing with Francis, and keeping him apprised of investigations by suspicious government officials into GDMA’s business.  In 2015, he pleaded guilty to bribery and fraud charges in a massive government investigation and agreed to cooperate with the probe. However, since late 2017 he has been living outside of the downtown federal lockup under the medical furlough arrangement. His release was approved and supervised by Sammartino and Pretrial Services. His precise medical problems were not disclosed for years, but it was known that he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2017. Defense lawyers for the former Navy officers have said they were entitled to more information on his medical condition and living arrangements, but motions filed before the trial seeking that information were rebuffed. After the trial and after Francis’ escape, defense lawyers again pressed for the information. In motions they contended Francis’ medical condition was not so dire, and that the required round-the-clock private security he was paying for — which was a condition of his release — was not round the clock or robust.  Some guards told reporters after the escape that they were largely confined to a windowless garage at the home, that Francis had family members living with him and access to phones and computers.", "Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.  Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts. When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.” Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,” her name would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,” according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.  She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec.", "Unknown to federal monitors, Francis had been moving belongings out of the property – he lived there with his mother and children, according to court documents – for several days as neighbors told federal authorities they saw several U-Haul trucks “coming in and out of the residence,” Castillo said. “There was more than one” seen on Friday or Saturday. Undated photo of Leonard Francis “We are following leads that have come into our national number, as well as our website, and we are following some leads that we have established ourselves,” he said. “As of now, we think he’s probably going international. It sounds like he’s been planning this for a while.” Castillo said he didn’t know what security arrangements were in place at Francis’ residence. He understands that Francis had security monitoring him, issued by the court, but paid for by Francis. “I can tell you nobody was there when we showed up,” he said. “Nobody was there.” It’s unclear how much time Francis had spent detained in U.S. physical custody before or after his conviction on a guilty plea. He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents. That arrangement, approved by Sammartino with prosecutors’ support, was based on round-the-clock monitoring by a GPS ankle bracelet and a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week physical guard at Francis’ residence."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The maximum fine the ICO can impose would be based on a calculation of 4% of TikTok’s global annual turnover.

The word Shavian has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them.  Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street[n 1] in Portobello, a lower-middle-class part of Dublin.[2] He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw (1814–1885) and Lucinda Elizabeth (Bessie) Shaw (née Gurly; 1830–1913). His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853–1920) and Elinor Agnes (1855–1876). The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland;[n 2] George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members.[3] His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant.[2] In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw's biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt.", "20] Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.[6]  Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.", "12] Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;[13] thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.[14]  Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.[15][n 3] His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"[16] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.[6] During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".[n 4]  In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.[6][n 5] Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward’s Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, “I come not to be served but to serve,” and was presented as Britain’s “undoubted king.” Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted “God save the king!” Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged. It was the culmination of a seven-decade journey for the king from heir to monarch. To the royal family and government, the occasion — code-named Operation Golden Orb — was a display of heritage, tradition and spectacle unmatched around the world.", "King Charles’s Coronation Live Updates: Follow Along with Vogue’s Live Coverage How to Watch the Coronation of King Charles III What to Look Out for at King Charles’s Coronation Everything You Need to Know About King Charles’s Coronation A Who’s Who of European Royals to Look Out for at the Coronation Charming, Approachable, and a Great Dancer: Friends of Vogue on the Real King Charles III By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

Dottie Cantrell Roman is a larger-than-life figure, especially in the country music world. She is known as the Queen of Country Music and the matriarch of the Roman family. She is a fighter who is tough as nails, willing to do whatever it takes to make sure her family maintains their status at the head of country music. Now, she is getting ready to step away from the music, but has a few orders of business to attend to before then, including making sure a few family secrets stay hidden. Playing Dottie Cantrell Roman is Susan Sarandon. Sarandon is a critically acclaimed and prolific actress with a slew of film and television appearances under her belt. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the 1995 film Dead Man Walking, where she plays a nun who comes into contact with an inmate on death row. The role also won her a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. She won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her role as Reggie in the legal thriller The Client. Sarandon has had many other iconic roles, including performances in Thelma & Louise, Little Women, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Atlantic City.", "December 8, 2022 6:10 PM (Photo by FOX via Getty Images) Fox's country music drama \"Monarch,\" starring Trace Adkins and featuring Susan Sarandon, has been canceled. The show capped its first season Tuesday night, and while \"Monarch\" opened with a strong rating and ranked as Fox's most-watched fall scripted debut in three years, the following 10 episodes didn't perform as well, Deadline reported. The show created by Melissa London Hilfers was ordered in May 2021 and was intended to launch in January 2022. The debut was scuttled to the fall as a result of the pandemic. \"Monarch\" is a multigenerational country music drama about country music's most influential family -- The Romans. The family is led by tough and talented Dottie Cantrell Roman, played by Sarandon, and her husband Albie, Adkins' character. Sarandon dies in the first episode. The Roman's success is at risk, and the family comes together to protect its legacy and future – and all costs. Executive producers for the Fox Entertainment-produced series include Hilfers, Gail Berman, Hend Baghdady, and Nashville power manager Jason Owen. \"Right now, we are all living in a really divided country,\" Owen told People when \"Monarch\" debuted. \"When times are tough, you look for something to sort of give you a break from all the noise.", "Adkins has even more acting experience; he said he's drawn to film and TV for the same reason he enjoys recording music. \"When I'm in the studio, it's just such a creative environment that stimulates me, and I just absolutely love it,\" he said. \"Television sets and movie sets are the same way. Everybody is so talented in that environment. I love the creativity, and I like being a part of it.\"   But even with his experience, he admitted, he was initially \"terrified\" to share scenes with Oscar winner Susan Sarandon.   \"And then,\" he said, \"I quickly realized, oh my God, she's so professional and so good that she's gonna carry the scene. So, if you don't throw up on yourself, you'll probably be OK because she's gonna do all the heavy lifting.

Those who prefer to buy at release will want to hold out until the newest models come out later this year.  If you just need an updated phone, don't want to wait, and aren't bothered by not having the latest bells and whistles, the iPhone 14 is an iPhone that will last for many years to come.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Plot twist: Susie swiftly discovers the missing student. So, just when you think you've fallen into the cozy stroll of a comfort crime watch, Susie Searches unearths new clues and tantalizing twists.  Susie is our chipper tour guide through her yarn wall of conspiracy theories, suspects, and kidnapping drama. However, as she grows closer to finding Jesse, she learns not everything — or everyone — is as they seem. Like Only Murders in the Building, this independent comedy is popping with colorful characters brought to life by chaotically charismatic performers.  Clemons, who has earned praise for tough girl turns in Dope and Sweetheart, plays a plucky oddball with aplomb. Wolff, who horrified in Hereditary, proves a terrific foil as the almost annoyingly zen Jesse. David Walton and Jim Gaffigan add a bit of grit as a pair of world-weary officers who find Susie equal parts pesky and peculiar. Ken Marino is smartly cast as an aggressive fast food joint manager who seems like a funhouse mirror version of his Party Down fool. And Rachel Sennott (Shiva Baby, Bodies Bodies Bodies) is a sparkling scene-stealer as a snotty mean girl who has no time but plenty of side-eye for our perky protagonist.  Co-writer/helmer Sophie Kargman makes her feature directorial debut with this charming comedy, which is based on her first short film.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "As a satirical look at our era’s growing fascination with celebrity in the digital age, there’s something to the fact that we are often the orchestrators of our own demise since shortcuts don’t need strong foundations. So while not without its flaws, there is still a lot to like about what Kargman puts on-screen. It showcases hubris incarnate as it destroys a “good” person by pushing her into corners that demand “bad” decisions to be made. Clemons is great in the role too. There’s always a keen sense of artifice that contradicts the way so many others see her smile as a sign of purity rather than a mask hiding the fact that her intelligence has corrupted her moral compass. Wolff excels by being her antithesis—morality refusing to bend to stardom. I like that it all gets darker as it continues and plays with earlier set-ups in perhaps surprising ways, but the pacing does leave a bit to be desired. A solid, imperfect debut.

He has been sponsored by M&M Mars since 2008 and Mars Inc. has been involved in NASCAR sponsorships for more than 25 years. Kyle Busch, Joe Gibbs Racing, M&M's Toyota Camry Photo by: David Rosenblum / NKP / Motorsport Images JGR has been unable to secure a primary sponsor for Busch’s #18 Toyota which would be comparable to the size of the financial investment from Mars Inc., although team officials have said they have come “close” on other prospects. That has led Busch to exploring options, including those from other manufacturers. In recent weeks, it was believed Busch was working on two viable options. One was moving to fellow Toyota team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by Busch’s JGR team-mate Denny Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan. That option was expected to cause the least issue with Busch’s KBM organisation. The other was joining RCR, which was looking for a new infusion of top talent after current driver Reddick informed the team in mid-July that he would not return to the organisation once his current contract expired at the end of the 2023 season.", "We look forward to working with Kyle starting in 2023.” Childress said sponsor announcements would be coming later. He said that he told Tyler Reddick about an hour before the announcement that he would not be in the No. 8 next year. Randall Burnett, who is serving as Reddick’s crew chief this season, will be Busch’s crew chief next year. Childress said RCR will have three charters for next year and have Busch, Reddick and Austin Dillon in its lineup.No one could have imagined at the start of the year this would be Busch’s last season with JGR. But Busch has been headed on this path after a sponsor pulled out of negotiations with Joe Gibbs Racing earlier this year. The team needed a new sponsor after Mars, Inc. announced last year that it would not return to the team and the series. Joe Gibbs Racing was in talks with Oracle, a technology corporation based in Austin, Texas, to sponsor Busch’s No. 18 team, but that fell through when the technology market changed and Oracle began looking at cutting costs and issuing layoffs. Without a sponsor, it became more difficult for Gibbs to sign Busch. He talked with other teams. Those who emerged as the leaders were Kaulig Racing, RCR and 23XI Racing. A pairing of Busch and Childress presents a unique tandem among former combatants.", "Reddick will join 23XI in 2024. However, Busch has had a frosty relationship with RCR owner Richard Childress during his career. In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.", "Busch joins a two-car RCR team that has Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick under contract for next season. RCR will presumably expand to three cars to accommodate Busch’s arrival, though the team could negotiate a buyout of Reddick’s contract that has one year remaining after Reddick announced earlier this year that he’s leaving to join 23XI Racing in 2024.

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

He won for his performance on the HBO limited series \"The Night Of.\"", "docs": ["In April, Ahmed was featured on the cover of Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in the world. “U.S. culture has a new mantra: it’s down with brown,” the Guardian wrote in May. “In the past few years, entertainers of south Asian origin have gone from being a minor footnote in American popular culture to a headline event.” But this shift has taken far too long, Wang Yuen argued, and the industry is far from where it should be. Ahmed’s historic win “punctuates the lack of Asian actor winners,” she said. Meanwhile, there were no Asian female acting nominees at this year’s Emmys. “Women were missing again,” Wang Yuen said. “Where were Constance Wu, Lucy Liu and Mindy Kaling?” “Talent is not the problem,” she also said, “but, to paraphrase Viola Davis’s speech from a few years ago, the only thing that separates Asian/American actors from anyone else is opportunity; you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Wang Yuen pioneered a study this year called “Tokens on the Small Screen: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Prime Time and Streaming Television.” Professors and scholars at six California universities surveyed 242 broadcast, cable and digital platform shows that aired during the 2015-2016 season.", "He also gave a shoutout to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people, and the Queens-based organization South Asian Youth Action. Ahmed told reporters after the Emmys that “what we’re starting to see is more awareness around how beneficial it can be to tell a diverse range of stories and to tell them in a way that’s authentic.” “And I think awareness is the first step to real change,” Ahmed added. Ahmed’s win wasn’t the only breakthrough of the night. Aziz Ansari, the son of Indian immigrants, won the comedy writing award for Netflix’s “Master of None,” after making history last year as the first South Asian person nominated for a leading role in a television series. He shared this year’s comedy writing award with Lena Waithe, who became the first black woman to win an Emmy for writing on a comedy series. “It’s a big year for the South Asian community and the Muslim community,” Nancy Wang Yuen, an expert on racial barriers in Hollywood, told The Washington Post. Scores of South Asians sounded off in agreement on social media. “When I was a little girl this was but a dream,” Canadian broadcast journalist Natasha Fatah tweeted, listing off Ansari and Ahmed’s names alongside two other prominent South Asian actors, Kumail Nanjiani and Priyanka Chopra. “#SouthAsiaRepresent.", "This article was published more than 5 years ago For nearly seven decades, a South Asian man had never won an Emmy in an acting category. That changed Sunday night with Riz Ahmed, a British actor of Pakistani descent, winning an Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for his role in HBO’s “The Night Of.” Before him, only one other South Asian star had taken home an acting award from the ceremony — Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy for her role in “The Good Wife” in 2010. Ahmed’s win was seen as a long-overdue victory for South Asians and his fellow Muslims. His success is significant not only because of his historic win, but because of the character he portrayed: Naz, a nuanced, relatable college student from Queens — who also happens to be Pakistani. While “The Night Of” tackles issues of race and Islamophobia, Naz’s ethnicity and religion are secondary to the story’s main plot. “It’s always strange reaping the rewards of a story that’s based on real world suffering,” Ahmed, who is also an activist and rapper, said in his acceptance speech. “But if this show has shown a light on some of the prejudice in our society, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, then maybe that’s something.", "He won for his performance on the HBO limited series The Night Of.

I’m really proud to be from the UK. I’m also really aware that actors of color often have more opportunity in the US, but I think ultimately now we see that TV in particular is a global medium,\" he said. \"People are streaming shows or watching them all around the world. Hopefully we’ll see a globalization of our storytelling.\" In a speech to the House of Commons in London earlier this year, the British-Pakistani actor made his case for representation of ethnic minorities in media. \"If we fail to represent, we are in danger of losing people to extremism,\" he said. \"People are looking for the message that they belong, that they are part of something, that they are seen and heard and that despite, or perhaps because of, their experience, they are valued.

Not long ago, most roles for South Asians were bit parts, and included “terrorists cab drivers and the odd medical professional,” as The Post’s Lavanya Ramanathan wrote last month. “A major metropolitan newspaper once counted Apu from ‘The Simpsons’ as a South Asian role — that’s how bad it was,” Ramanathan wrote. Mindy Kaling’s “The Mindy Project” was the first show written by and starring an Indian American woman.

Each month coinciding with the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of the Consumer Price Index, JEC Republicans’ State Inflation Tracker estimates how much inflation increases costs for American families in each state and how the drivers of inflation continue to vary across the country. Specifically, we ask: how much more must the average household pay today to maintain the same standard of living it achieved in January 2021, the last time inflation was within historical norms? See our methodology for a full description of our methods and a downloadable data file with a detailed breakdown of inflation costs by state. You can find our full analysis for August 2022 here. See the highlights below: Prices were relatively unchanged from July 2022 to August 2022. However, prices have increased 13.2 percent from January 2021 to August 2022, costing the average American household $715 last month alone. Even if prices stop increasing altogether, the inflation that has already occurred will cost the average American household $8,581 over the next 12 months. Families in the Mountain West (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) are facing the highest inflation rates, with prices today 15.6 percent higher than in January 2021.", "In the United States overall, the monthly inflation cost in August 2022 was highest within transportation ($281), followed by energy ($157), food ($99), and shelter ($95). Due to a combination of higher inflation rates and higher average household spending, inflation is imposing the greatest monthly costs on families in the states of Colorado ($953), Utah ($925), and Arizona ($847). Annualized, these families are facing inflation costs of $11,438, $11,100, and $10,167 over the next year, respectively. For the average American household, inflation costs were essentially unchanged from July to August, decreasing by $2. Seventeen states saw inflation cost increases and 33 states saw inflation cost decreases. Monthly inflation costs increased the most in the states of New Jersey ($25), New York ($24), and Pennsylvania ($21). Inflation costs decreased the most in Tennessee ($27), Alabama and Kentucky ($26 each), and Mississippi ($24). In the United States overall, the monthly inflation cost in August 2022 was highest within transportation ($281), followed by energy ($157), food ($99), and shelter ($95). Families in Colorado are facing the highest transportation inflation costs ($372) and shelter inflation costs ($169); families in California are facing the highest food inflation costs ($122); and families in Texas are facing the highest energy inflation costs ($209).", "Source: JEC Calculations using: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Consumption Expenditures; Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditure Survey; Census Bureau; American Community Survey.Notes: Inflation rates reflect how much prices have increased since January 2021, and inflation costs reflect how much more the average U.S. household must pay in the current month for the same goods and services it purchased in January 2021.

However, according to a new rumor, the Breath of the Wild 2 name may finally have leaked online. While “new details” about the Zelda game come and go, the newest rumor might hold more water than the others. While the alleged title is still a rumor, the next adventure of Link and Zelda is “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality.” According to Nintendo Life, the report comes from veteran video game journalist Paul Gale “who runs his own website, appeared in Nintendo Power, and worked with many other video game outlets over the years,” according to Nintendo Life. In a post, Gale reports that “the sequel to BotW and its main hook is right in the name, which establishes on the ‘Breath’ familiarity from the 2017 hit and [gives] a nod to the fact that you can play as more than the aforementioned title’s Link (including various, polar themes), hence ‘Duality.’” RUMOR: A potential Breath of the Wild 2 title has been spreading around online https://t.co/hy4V0WiTX2 pic.twitter.", "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild[b] is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U.

Players explore the open world of Hyrule while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles or side quests. Breath of the Wild's world is unstructured and encourages exploration and experimentation; the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.  Development lasted five years, commencing immediately after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in 2011. Led by director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and producer Eiji Aonuma, Nintendo sought to rethink Zelda's conventions and introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and physics engines. The designers drew inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus (2005) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011). Monolith Soft, known for their work on the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography.  Breath of the Wild was first planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive. It was eventually released on March 3, 2017, as a launch game for the Switch and the final Nintendo game for the Wii U.

Nintendo has almost given players their wishes in games like The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. However, the “Duality” could give gamers the chance to control the titular princess. “If real, it does make sense as to why Nintendo and Mr. Eiji Aonuma have been so hush-hush on the title,” Gale reports. “If fake or not final-yet-close to what the actual name ends up being, this still makes for an interesting topic to discuss.” Nintendo Treehouse’s Bill Trinen told IGN in 2021 why they kept the name so guarded. “As for why we’re holding back on the name, you’ll just have to stay tuned because, obviously, Zelda names are kind of important,” Trinen said. “Those subtitles … they start to give little bits of hints about maybe what’s going to happen.” The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, has an update to share about the launch timing of the sequel to The Legend of #Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Nintendo Life journalist, Paul Gale, shared a blogpost on his own website, claiming that a source close to Nintendo informed him of the name. Apparently, the company wants to capitalise on the fact that the name 'Breath of the Wild' is synonymous with 'amazing game', but they also want to hit home that you can play as more than just Link.  In the post, Gale continued that there was another benefit to the word 'duality', saying: \"...duality between character abilities, on land and floating regions, past and present, darkness and light, etc.\" Sadly, as is the case with these things sometimes, the insider apparently \"did note that this name was seen a considerable amount of time ago and could have been one of many template titles.\" So by now, the name could've changed.

Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.", "On 25 October, Meloni gave her first official speech as Prime Minister in front of the Chamber of Deputies, before the confidence vote on her cabinet.[132][133] During her speech, she stressed the weight of being the first woman to serve as head of the Italian government.[134] She thanked several Italian women including Tina Anselmi, Samantha Cristoforetti, Grazia Deledda, Oriana Fallaci, Nilde Iotti, Rita Levi-Montalcini, and Maria Montessori, who she said, \"with the boards of their own examples, built the ladder that today allows me to climb and break the heavy glass ceiling placed over our heads\".[135][136] The government won the confidence vote with a comfortable majority in both houses.[137][138]  One of the first measures implemented by the government regarded COVID-19 and concerned with the complete removal of the COVID-19 vaccination certificate, known in Italy as the Green Pass; moreover, non-vaccinated doctors were re-integrated into service.[139] By this time, the government’s workforce vaccination mandate had been in place for over one year, rendering the edict largely symbolic.

As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]", "30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]", "He succeeded in being elected by obtaining 116 votes out of 206 in the first round thanks to the support from opposition parties to the centre-right coalition.[117][118][119] Tensions further grew, in particular between Berlusconi and Meloni, whom Berlusconi described as \"patronising, overbearing, arrogant ... [and] offensive\" in a series of written notes in the Senate.[120][121] In the following days, after meetings between parties' leader, tensions loosened and the centre-right coalition parties reached an agreement on the formation of the new cabinet.[122]  On 20 October, consultations between President Sergio Mattarella and parties officially began. On the following day, delegates from FdI, the League, FI, and Civics of Italy–Us Moderates–MAIE, announced to Mattarella they had reached an agreement to form a coalition government with Meloni as Prime Minister.[123][124] In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace, asking her to form a new government.[125] She accepted the task and on the same day announced the composition of her cabinet, which was officially sworn in on 22 October.[126][127][128] She is the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of Italy.[129][130][131]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

It was credited as a Yarmolenko own goal, but who cares? For many, the greatest player that Wales has ever produced. Came close to a second but was denied by Bushchan.

Again, there’s no confirmed price details from Google at this point in time. With the Pixel Watch only being released in October 2022, we don’t think there will be too much change from the price of that smartwatch: We don’t know the official specs of the Google Pixel Watch 2 yet, so we’re relying on the rumours that have surfaced so far to give us a clue on what we might see when the new model arrives.", "You can read our full Pixel Watch review for all of our in-depth analysis, but the overall takeaway is that we were left with an expectation that Google is just getting started. We fully expect to see a Pixel Watch 2 in the not-to-distant future. For starters, the lineup stands out among Wear OS-based wearables with a streamlined, Google-centric user experience and unique Fitbit integration. As such, it’s already a popular device with plenty of market value despite its shortcomings. Additionally, activity in the Fitbit stable suggests Google may be moving more of its chips into the Pixel Watch pot. For example, Fitbit’s smartwatches no longer offer third-party app support, further elevating the value of a true smartwatch experience paired with Fitbit tracking features. Respected leaker Evan Blass tweeted an image containing the words “Pixel Watch 2” on May 9. It’s unclear if this image was derived from an official source. Nevertheless, this is as close as we’ve gotten to a Pixel Watch 2 confirmation given Blass’s reliability. Check out the image below. A report from 9to5Google in late May that details some of the Pixel Watch 2’s specs also appears to confirm that Google is working on a sequel to its smartwatch. In another report from the outlet, an APK teardown appears to have revealed a new codename, “eos.” Prior to this information, a leak revealed the codename “aurora.", "17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist.[75][76] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout.

(Kyodo News via AP)         TOKYO (AP) — A rare state funeral for Shinzo Abe, the former prime minister who was assassinated in July, has split Japan.  The hawkish Abe was one of the nation’s most divisive postwar leaders, but it is the ruling party’s cozy ties with the ultra-conservative Unification Church that has fired up much of the opposition to the funeral.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is battling a near-continuous political fallout from his handling of both the links to the church among his party’s lawmakers and the state funeral he says Abe deserves.  A look at some of the reasons why the state funeral on Tuesday is causing so much anger:  The tradition has roots in a ceremony performed by the emperor to honor those who made exceptional contributions to the country.  The emperor before World War II was revered as a god, and public mourning for those honored with state funerals was compulsory. Most state funerals were for members of the imperial family, but political and military leaders were also honored, including Isoroku Yamamoto, who commanded Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack and died in 1943.  The state funeral law was scrapped after the war.", "Recent opinion polls showed a majority of people opposed the ceremony, with many citing its ¥1.6bn ($11m) price tag. A private funeral for Abe was held in Tokyo four days after he was shot dead while making an election campaign speech in the western city of Nara on 8 July. “I know it’s divisive and there are a lot of people against this, but there were so many people lined up to offer flowers,” said Yoshiko Kojima, a 63-year-old Tokyo resident who was among the mourners on Tuesday. “I felt that now the funeral is actually taking place, many people have come out to pray for him.", "Public anger at  cost of  ceremony for former PM and revelations over his party’s ties to religious group A state funeral for Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been held in Tokyo amid public anger over the cost of the ceremony and revelations over his party’s ties to a controversial religious group. More than 4,000 guests, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, stood in silence as a member of Japan’s self-defence forces entered the Nippon Budokan hall, where a 19-gun salute sounded in honour of the assassinated former leader. Abe’s widow, Akie, dressed in a black kimono, carried her late husband’s ashes into the hall, followed by Japan’s crown prince, Akishino, and other members of the imperial family. Abe was killed in early July by a man armed with a homemade gun who has reportedly told police that he had targeted the conservative politician over his support for the Unification church. Amid tight security, people opposed to the funeral demonstrated as thousands of mourners queued to lay flowers and offer prayers in a park near the venue. After a video showcasing Abe’s achievements, set to footage of the former prime minister playing the piano, the current leader, Fumio Kishida, paid tribute to his friend and predecessor.", "(Yoshikazu Tsuno/Pool Photo via AP)                                                           TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s assassinated hawkish former leader, Shinzo Abe, was given a rare state funeral Tuesday full of military pomp and surrounded by throngs of mourners as well as by widespread protests, with thousands taking to the streets in opposition. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the publicly financed ceremony was a well-deserved honor for Japan’s longest-serving modern political leader. The event was attended by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Japanese Crown Prince Akishino and other foreign and Japanese dignitaries.  Japan’s main political opposition parties boycotted the funeral, which critics say was a reminder of how prewar imperialist governments used state funerals to fan nationalism. The government maintains that the ceremony was not meant to force anyone to honor Abe. But the decision to give him the rare honor — which was made without parliamentary debate or approval — as well as the funeral’s high cost and other controversies have led to anger about the event. The funeral began with Abe’s widow, Akie Abe, in a black formal kimono, walking slowly behind Kishida into the funeral venue, carrying an urn in a wooden box wrapped in a purple cloth with gold stripes. Soldiers in white uniforms took Abe’s ashes and placed them on a pedestal filled with white and yellow chrysanthemums and decorations.", "Anthony Kuhn                        A portrait of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe hangs above the stage during his state funeral in the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo on Tuesday.

Roads were closed around the Nippon Budokan Hall, where the event was held. Some 20,000 police were mobilized to prevent the sort of security lapses which allowed Abe's suspected killer to walk behind him at a July 8 campaign event and shoot him twice with a homemade shotgun.

R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons\".  House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season.", "The teaser also features the queen and the princess’ latest spat, with tempers flaring so much that Alicent publicly pulls a knife on Rhaenyra. Now that the pivotal sixth episode has made its way to air, we’re officially in the back stretch of the season. House of the Dragon is down to its final four episodes, and should the series continue to release on a weekly basis, the rest of the season should air as follows: Though Alicent and Rhaenyra were at the center of Episode 6, the marriage between Daemon (Matt Smith) and Laena resulted in the fiery death of House Velaryon’s eldest daughter. Her early demise will have consequences, considering Episode 7 is titled, “Driftmark,” which is the seat of House Velaryon. Expect plenty from Corlys (Steve Toussaint) and Rhaenys (Eve Best), who’ll be trying to pick up the pieces following their daughter’s death. Episode 6 had one of the longest runtimes of the season, totaling 67 minutes. With so much to cover across the 10-year gap, a little extra time seemed necessary. But Episode 7 will serve as the shortest episode in the series so far, slated for just under an hour at 59 minutes. Episode 7 will likely revolve around the Velaryons in Driftmark.

It's had a strong history of success in motorsports, correctly predicting seven winners during the 2021 NASCAR season and its projected leaderboards have forecasted winners across multiple racing formats. The model has been scorching hot when it comes to picking Formula 1 race events dating back to 2021. It nailed both of Leclerc's wins in 2022, and at the 2021 Mexican Grand Prix, the model was strongly backing Verstappen as its top pick. The result: Verstappen dominated the field and ran away with a surprise victory. The model followed that up by calling Verstappen's win at the Rolex Emilia Romagna GP in April and then nailed his wins again each of the last two weeks in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anyone who followed the model's lead on those plays has seen huge returns Now, the model has dialed in on the 2022 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix and just released its coveted picks and leaderboard projections. You can head to SportsLine now to see the complete 2022 Japanese GP leaderboard projection. One massive shocker: McClure is fading Perez even though he's the fourth favorite for the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix at 11-1.", "4s adrift of his teammate at Suzuka and behind both Ferraris was poor, as was coming home nearly half a minute down on Verstappen having failed to pass a slower race-pace car on badly worn tyres. Perez and his fans are right to point out that he's now second in the 2022 standings and has earned Red Bull's trust in doing what Gasly and Alex Albon couldn't in picking up the pieces if Verstappen isn't around to hold them. Plus, his defence/attack against Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and Leclerc last weekend helped seal Verstappen's two titles. This is all to his credit. But the picture is only rosy if Red Bull keeps winning easily. If another team/driver combo in the future produces a stiffer challenge than Ferrari/Leclerc in 2022, then the unbalanced Red Bull line-up will be exposed. With four dead rubbers now to come, Perez should focus on closing the performance gap to Verstappen, which is particularly prevalent on the purpose-built facilities that make up the bulk of the calendar, and on building momentum for 2023.

A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap.[13] Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.[14]  The race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez.

Along with Adrianna, the movie will also feature the big screen debut of Justice Society of America, or JSA. The iconic superhero team will no doubt clash with Johnson's superpowered champion, with the Justice Society of America set to be made up of Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate. Shahi's role in proceedings was not the only Black Adam mystery, with Marwan Kenzari, Bodhi Sabongui, and James Cusati-Moyer all cast in currently unknown roles. Black Adam finally going into production marks another achievement for Dwayne Johnson, with the actor and Hollywood superstar having been signed on to play the role for over a decade. \"Black Adam has been with me for over ten years now. That gives you an idea of how passionate I am about this project,\" Johnson said last year of his commitment to the project. \"How passionate our Seven Bucks is about this project. Warner Bros., New Line Cinemas, DC, they have been so incredibly supportive over the years,\" Johnson continued. \"In 2008 was when we first started talking about this. So, it has required patience by all of us as partners.", "So the idea of seeking revenge to protect your family, or to redeem the death of your loved ones, is something that I think resonates with the two of them. Adrianna was like Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones. And so it was important not only to show just her toughness and her ability in that sense but also her vulnerabilities and the softness in her. Because she does, kind of, become the Black Adam Whisperer. To watch that transition happen and to see how they affect each other in that space was also important.”   Adrianna may not be able to shoot electricity through her eyes yet, but if Black Adam gets sequels to continue the story, that day may be coming. Isis has powers akin to Black Adam’s (superstrength, energy manipulation, flight, etc.) and control over all of the elements. Her future powers may mirror Black Adam’s but in this movie, it is the commonality of loss that unites this unlikely pair.  Vengeance is not something Steve Rogers would condone, but revenge has a long history in the world of comic book superheroism. Ghost Rider, Punisher, Deadpool, and more antiheroes have brought about positive change through grim acts of retaliation, and it sounds like Black Adam and Adrianna Tomaz are joining the cause.", "Perhaps Black Adam's Adrianna/Isis has been separated from Adam, and part of the story will feature their reunion. Right now, the film's plot is still being kept under wraps, so everything is speculation. Still, come next year, audiences just might meet the goddess Isis on the big screen.", "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she’s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.", "Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase.

All rights reserved.", "Telling the true story of one of the NBA greats, 'Sweetwater' is just around the corner.  Sports biopics have a long illustrious history within cinema, and in recent years they have taken our screens by storm. Some standout favorites include the likes of Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya starring Margot Robbie, the recent Netflix biopic The Swimmers, and the highly-praised Ford v Ferrari. The hunger for more sports biopics is great, and the eyes of the world constantly await the next offering. Well, one such offering is just around the corner, in the form of Martin Guigui's Sweetwater (2023). Telling the tale of Nat Clifton, an NBA Hall of Famer, the film itself has been in the works since 2007 and is finally being released this year. Of course, we know that the movie will be about the life of Nat Clifton, but a film cannot simply show every aspect of a person's life, and will often choose a specific period of importance. The official plot synopsis of Sweetwater reads: \"The film follows Clifton, who is the star attraction of the Harlem Globetrotters, led by owner/coach Abe Saperstein.", "Of course, as well as this, there is likely to be a DVD release of the movie, which is also worth keeping an eye out for. Yes, there is a trailer for Sweetwater, and it can be watched below: The themes of the film are striking throughout the trailer, with the opening line \"It ain't about the color of my skin\" resonating instantly. The dramatic score and intense dialogue set up a feeling of triumph through adversity, and it looks as if Sweetwater may just be one of the most feel-good movies hitting theaters this Spring. Every good biopic has a strong and often inspiring central character, and Sweetwater is no different. Born in Arkansas in October 1922, Nat Clifton, nicknamed \"Sweetwater\" because of his love for fizzy drinks, showed his true talent for basketball throughout his time in school. After serving in the US Army during World War II, Clifton made it back safely and began his career in professional basketball. As a member of the famous Harlem Globetrotters, Clifton would cement his legacy as an all-time great when he became only the second African-American to sign an NBA contract, just four days after Earl Lloyd. In 2014, some 24 years after his death, Clifton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, perfectly summarizing his incredible career."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Julian Chokkattu nearly a decade after Google launched its Android Wear smartwatch platform—now called Wear—a Google-made watch is finally here. It's called the Pixel Watch. The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.  There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8. Speaking of Apple, these Pixel Watches lack any sort of iPhone compatibility. Google's taking a page from Apple and limiting the Pixel Watch for use with Android phones only.

See our ethics statement. I was cautiously optimistic — dare I say, excited? — following my hands-on with the Pixel Watch last week. While I hadn’t been impressed with the dozens of leaks and official renders, the $349.99 ($399.99 for LTE) Pixel Watch left a much stronger impression in person. That, and the bar for the Pixel Watch is low. This watch’s one job is to not suck. But after a week of testing, it’s fair to say I’ve tempered my expectations. The Pixel Watch is a good first attempt from Google, but the company has a lot of growing pains to work out for the next iteration of the watch. That is, assuming it doesn’t prematurely kill it off.  From the curved glass to the digital crown, Google isn’t shy that it took its design cues for the Pixel Watch from Apple. It’s a smart move, actually. Whether it’s blinged-out Fossil watches or Samsung’s subtler Galaxy Watches, Wear OS devices by and large opt for a more analog feel.", "65] Nicole Nguyen of The Wall Street Journal did not find the smartwatch particularly astounding and noted several software bugs, but ultimately deemed it a worthy companion to the Pixel phone.[66]  Analyst firm Canalys calculated that Google shipped an estimated 880,000 Pixel Watches during the fourth quarter of 2022, constituting 22 percent of Google's total wearable sales, which include Fitbit products. The Pixel Watch's launch allowed Google to obtain 8 percent of the wearable market share, jumping 16 percent from fourth place to second place, behind Apple.[67] The Pixel Watch Android app had amassed more than 500,000 downloads by February 2023.[68]  In May 2023, it was reported that Google was aiming to launch a second-generation Pixel Watch later that year, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.[69]", "17][18] Two months later, Business Insider reported that a Pixel-branded smartwatch codenamed \"Rohan\" was being targeted for a 2022 release, featuring a round bezel-less design, integration with Fitbit, proprietary watch bands, and health-tracking capabilities.[19][20] Evidence unearthed that month indicated that the watch would be powered by either Samsung's Exynos system-on-chip (SoC) or Google's own Tensor chip, the latter of which had recently debuted on the company's Pixel 6 smartphone line.[21] In April 2022, the \"Fitbit\" category was renamed \"Watches\" on the online Google Store, in anticipation of the Pixel Watch's impending launch.[22] The same month, Google filed a trademark for the \"Pixel Watch\" name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,[23] while three models of the smartwatch were approved by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.[24] A prototype of the Pixel Watch was found at a restaurant in the U.S., an incident which drew comparisons to Gizmodo's leak of Apple's iPhone 4 in 2010.[25][26]  Osterloh unveiled a preview of the Pixel Watch on May 11, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

And it is love that propels mothers and fathers, spouses, siblings, children — to hold them and care for them when they return, with wounds seen, and unseen.” Savannah called out by name specific caregivers she's encountered, like Colleen Rose, who nursed her husband through devastating burn injuries, and Pat Ochan, who cares for her husband and raises their son all while juggling her job and pursuing a Ph.D.", "“Over the past four years, she has become deeply invested in our cause. She has brought our caregivers’ stories of service and sacrifice into millions of homes across America. And she has gone above and beyond, with such grace and compassion, to speak directly to military caregivers and ensure them that they are not alone.” Senator Elizabeth Dole was the first to call the nation’s attention to the men and women caring for a wounded, ill, or injured service member or veteran at home. Military caregivers face increased emotional and physical stress, financial and legal troubles, employment difficulties, and feelings of isolation due to the enormous responsibility and severe lack of resources for those caring for someone who served. The Foundation is committed to recognizing, supporting, and empowering military caregivers. The event is open to media.

You make me want to live up to your example. You are my heroes.” Alex Portée is a senior trending reporter at TODAY Digital and is based in Los Angeles.", "“We are thrilled to honor our champion, Savannah, during our 10th anniversary celebration,” said Steve Schwab, CEO of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, in a news release. “Over the past four years, she has become deeply invested in our cause.

And Hidden Heroes started doing it 10 years ago, and it is the key operative motor.”  Tom Hanks Hanks is best known as an actor and director, creating feel-good masterpieces like Big, Toy Story, and That Thing You Do, but also for creating historical epics that chart the stories of our men and women at war, like Saving Private Ryan or the HBO series “Band of Brothers.” Maybe this fascination with the Greatest Generation is what led to his work with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation and supporting military caregivers as the chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign. Hanks has been candid in saying that it’s way more simple, when Elizabeth Dole asks for your help, you don’t say no.

It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Riot Games' publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversees the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the League of Legends universe.  Riot Games operates 12 international League of Legends esports leagues, the League of Legends World Championship and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 20 offices worldwide as of 2023, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues. Riot has faced allegations and lawsuits claiming a toxic workplace culture, including gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The company was criticized for its use of forced arbitration in response to these allegations.  Riot Games' founders Brandon \"Ryze\" Beck and Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill became friends while roommates at the University of Southern California, where the two studied business.[3] Beck and Merrill believed too many video game developers diverted their focus from game to game too often, distinguishing Defense of the Ancients as an indication that games could be supported and monetized long-term.", "5] On May 10, 2010, Riot Games announced that they would take over distribution and operation of their game in Europe; to do so, Riot Games relocated their European headquarters in Brighton to new offices in Dublin.[12] In February 2011, Tencent invested $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games.[5][13] Tencent bought the remaining 7 percent on December 16, 2015; the price was not disclosed.[5][14]  In 2012, in response to toxicity and harassment in League of Legends, Riot Games launched a \"player behavior team\" of psychologists to combat harassment on its platform.[15][16] Riot Games' tactics to address issues on League of Legends, including an opt-in chat function between opposing players, informing banned players of the reasoning behind the ban, and creating a tribunal of players to weigh in on bans, resulted in a 30 percent drop in reported harassment behavior.[15] The efficacy of their results has been questioned by players and the gaming press.[17] By 2013, League of Legends was the most-played multiplayer PC game in the world.[18][19] By 2016, Inc. reported the game had over 100 million monthly players.[5]  Riot Games relocated to a new building on a 20-acre (8 hectare) campus in western Los Angeles in 2015.", "In the most significant deal that the Northern Ireland games industry has seen to date, Derry-based studio Hypixel Studios has been bought by games industry giant Riot Games.

But that isn’t quite certain yet, and we’re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.” “For God of War, the project started a little later. So we’ve made the decision to push that game out to next year, to ensure that Santa Monica Studio can deliver the amazing God of War game that we all want to play.”    Christopher Judge, the voice actor behind Kratos, has revealed that God Of War: Ragnarok was delayed due to an illness he faced in 2019. Taking to Twitter, Judge stated “Ragnarok was delayed because of me” and explained that in 2019 he faced significant health issues leaving him unable to walk. The illness required “back surgery, both hips replaced, and knee surgery” as well as rehab, which Sony Santa Monica waited for him to recover from. Judge added that he received “nothing but love and support” from Sony Santa Monica, who “never said a word about the delay, and what caused it.” Grace Orlady, the senior manager of Santa Monica Studio, has already teased some key details about what we can expect from the game when it launches in a PlayStation Blog post. “As you can see in the trailer, we’re picking up a few years after the events of God of War (2018).", "23][24] The game's title was confirmed to be God of War Ragnarök during the following year's showcase event,[25] although earlier that year, the title had accidentally been leaked.[26][27][28] Although the 2018 installment was ported to Windows (PC) in January 2022, Barlog, who served as a producer and creative director for the sequel, could not confirm if Ragnarök would also receive a PC port.[29]  Development of the game was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed that the game had been delayed, partly due to the pandemic,[30] as he stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent.[22] Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development.[31]  The delay brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. Due to the change in his voice, supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco said \"We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time\".", "Here's the release date for God of War Ragnarok. God of War Ragnarok is official – for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War… so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that’s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

He had said that he had secured the backing of 102 legislators and could have been “back in Downing Street” but he had failed to persuade either Sunak or Mordaunt to come together and back him “in the national interest”. “I believe I have much to offer, but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time,” Johnson said. The Tories retain a majority in parliament, meaning that as their leader, Sunak will be named prime minister by King Charles III. Economists have questioned whether Sunak can tackle the country’s finances while holding the party’s multiple warring factions together. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt – the fourth person in that role in four months – is due to present a budget on October 31 to plug a black hole in the public finances, which is expected to have ballooned to up to 40 billion pounds ($45.2bn). Conservative political commentator Alex Deane noted that the last three Conservative prime ministers have been brought down by members of their own party. “So it’s very nice to hear people say good things about our new leader,” Deane told Al Jazeera. “[Sunak] didn’t have a direct electoral mandate,” Deane said. “… One of the things he is going to have to do … is preside over a period of relative calm, reassuring the markets and not doing anything too bold or too rapid.", "Once the Party had elected a new leader, that person would, of course, be invited to take over as Prime Minister.  Additionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.[35]  On 6 April 2020, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted into ICU, he asked First Secretary of State Dominic Raab \"to deputise for him where necessary\".[36]  A prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch.[37] This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons,[38] or for other reasons such as ill-health.[39] If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours.", "31] There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom.[32] Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011,[33] the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:[34] There is no single protocol setting out all of the possible implications. However, the general constitutional position is as set out below. There can be no automatic assumption about who The Queen would ask to act as caretaker Prime Minister in the event of the death of the Prime Minister. The decision is for her under the Royal Prerogative. However, there are some key guiding principles. The Queen would probably be looking for a very senior member of the Government (not necessarily a Commons Minister since this would be a short-term appointment). If there was a recognised deputy to the Prime Minister, used to acting on his behalf in his absences, this could be an important factor. Also important would be the question of who was likely to be in contention to take over long-term as Prime Minister. If the most senior member of the Government was him or herself a contender for the role of Prime Minister, it might be that The Queen would invite a slightly less senior non-contender. In these circumstances, her private secretary would probably take soundings, via the Cabinet Secretary, of members of the Cabinet, to ensure that The Queen invited someone who would be acceptable to the Cabinet to act as their chair during the caretaker period.", "No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[40] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.

This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:   His Majesty the King [Her Majesty the Queen] has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.[41] Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3]  In 2010, the prime minister received £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[42] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.

The fifth season was initially expected to be the show’s final installment and take the royals from the early ’90s into the 2000s, however showrunner Peter Morgan later changed his mind, deciding instead to split the events of the decade into two seasons. “As we started to discuss the storylines for series five, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said.

Apparently, the break was planned all along.  After Season 4 debuted last fall, fans will have to wait more than a year for the next installment. Of course, this isn't the first time The Crown has taken a long break; there was a two-year wait between Seasons 2 and 3 too.

Though the series likely won't make it all the way to 2022, the critically acclaimed show will have a few more chapters. Season 5 of the critically acclaimed series premiered in full on Netflix in November 2022, and is now nominated for four Golden Globes, including a nomination for Best Drama Series, as well as Imelda Staunton for Best Television Actress in a Drama Series, Elizabeth Debicki for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, and Jonathan Pryce for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series.  Staunton's nomination, in particular, has fans excited—if she wins, all three of the actresses who have helmed the show in the role of Queen Elizabeth II will have garnered the Best Actress Golden Globe.

If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden’s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.  The majority of House districts aren’t competitive, thanks to a redistricting process that allows state legislatures to draw their own congressional lines if they decide to. Many legislatures draw lines to give advantages to one party or the other.

Super PACS and political party groups were spending money almost exclusively in districts that President Biden won in 2020, indicating that Democrats were in a defensive crouch. Midterm elections often benefit the opposition political party at the expense of the White House’s party. 1994 and 2010 were typical midterm elections, where Republicans made gains in the House at the midpoint of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s first terms. Similarly, in 2018, Republican’s got crushed in House elections but picked up two seats in the Senate. If a president’s approval ratings are high, then the presiding party typically fares better in midterm House elections. For example, in 1998, Bill Clinton’s approval rating was 66%, and Democrats retained control of the House. In 2002, George W. Bush polled at a 63%, and Republicans made gains. Currently, Biden’s approval rating is 42%, which is similar to former president Barack Obama’s rating in 2010. That year, Democrats lost control of the House, similar to what occurred during this year’s midterms. After each census, congressional district lines are redrawn. This Nov. 8 election was the first general election since the redistricting process concluded.", "In the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won 224 districts, and Donald Trump won 211. Under new districting, Biden won 226 districts, and Trump won 209. Voters typically engage in “straight ticket” voting, meaning that they vote the same way for the House and Senate as they do for presidential elections. However, when breaking down the 2020 election results further, the number of districts that Trump won by more than 15 points goes from 132 under old maps to 143 under new maps. Under new district lines, there are only 33 districts that either Trump or Biden won by fewer than five percentage points. In this year’s House race, 33 districts were rated as toss ups, which made the 2022 midterm election close.

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected. Like many midterm projections, these estimates are based on aggregated data. There is no measure of current national controversies (for example, abortion or Trump-related litigation controversies).

In another key race, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak lost his reelection bid to his Republican challenger, sheriff Joe Lombardo, on Friday night. Nevada’s count has taken several days partly because of the mail voting system created by the state Legislature in 2020 that requires counties to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day if they arrive up to four days later. Even after the counts are finished this weekend, voters have until the end of the day Monday to “cure” — or fix clerical problems with — their mail ballots, enabling those to be added into the final tally. Gloria said there are 9,600 ballots in the “cure” stage in Clark County, home to three-quarters of the state’s population.", "The AP concluded Cortez Masto’s lead would carry even if Republican Adam Laxalt made gains in rural Nevada counties that are still counting votes. Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.  Those categories accounted for nearly 90% of the vote in 2020’s presidential election.

However, it mentions that Millie Gibson is joining the show, but it's not clear if she will be the Doctor's companion in the series or in a specific episode. For a definitive", "docs": ["Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.", "\"It's the great honor of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already,\" said showrunner Russell T.

In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who (though initially presented as an \"unearthly child\") was intended[citation needed] as an identification figure for younger viewers.", "The 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her “fam,” and in the big finale episode – “The Power of the Doctor” — several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10.

(Asked about her favorite memories of her own wedding, Dr. Biden recalled how “spontaneously Beau and Hunter, little boys at the time, stood at the altar with me and Joe.”) The pair sit together on the mint striped-silk sofa. The first lady’s dress is structured with a built-in corset, but Dr. Biden assures the crew she’s perfectly comfortable and can do whatever is needed. “I can move, but I don’t know if my dress will,” she says with a laugh when Vogue’s photographer, Norman Jean Roy, asks her to turn toward Naomi.

Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House.

She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.

Lol That’s what I came to post! 😂😂😂 Not our Matt… I love him but it will be hard to get used to him as the bad guy I wasn’t up to date on the show when it ended, so my interest in this was just above minimal, plus add in the fact that we wont have Reid. This sounds like it could be good though. I might move this up on my watch list. Would be hard to bring Spencer back just because he and JJ admitted  they have feeling for each other, although it could have been an on going tension between them in the new shows. No Dr. Reid, no me. Reid was the bomb on here not sure I can watch this new show It’s too bad that this revival will only be on Paramount+ – what about the rest of the country/world who don’t subscribe to that system?

From what I’ve read about it so far I’m liking the new format, it will be different and interesting to watch a continuing story all through the season. I’m really looking forward to it. 😊 The character they shouldn’t really bring back is Hotch! The show was never as good with him! Not sure if I will watch. No Michael Gray Gubler, that’s upsetting. It is the 16th season or a new series ?? I am really upset it will be on Paramount plus as I can’t afford more money on our cable bill., as my husband and I are retired.   This was m y favorite show.  Many others are in our situation. I’d love to see MGG in a reboot of the Ellery Queen Mysteries with him in the lead role. I love the show I’ve watched it at least four….. I’m so glad Criminal Minds is coming back! So sorry that the character Spencer won’t be back. We loved his character so much.

Alberts was in attendance at Iowa City. The second-year Nebraska AD, originally from Eastern Iowa, traveled separately from the Huskers to attend the final game of the season. An introductory news conference in Lincoln for Rhule could come as early as Sunday. Nebraska officials, without direct instruction from Alberts on the timing, have reserved the Hawks Championship Center for use to stage a hiring event. Rhule’s personality will mesh with the state of Nebraska. He’s a New York native and thrived as a head coach in Pennsylvania and Texas. So he’s adaptable. Nebraskans will like his work ethic and the respect that he’s shown already for the Nebraska program, which has won or shared five national titles. He said Saturday on ESPN’s “College GameDay” that he grew up “revering” the Huskers. Rhule talked before the announcement with former coach Tom Osborne and praised the leadership at the university, including Joseph, the well-liked former Nebraska QB who coached the team for the final nine games this season after Frost was fired. — Sherman He’s big on building culture, a must for Nebraska — which has lacked an identity on offense for far too long. Rhule emphasizes physical play. His track record at Temple and Baylor backs it up. Nebraska talked a big game about physicality under Frost, but its play on the field belied that message.", "Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\" Rhule said it is an honor to lead the Nebraska program and join the Lincoln community. He is excited to return to the college game and the opportunity to coach in the Big Ten Conference.  \"When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top of the list,” Rhule said. “The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. My family and I are so grateful to become a part of the Husker family, and we can't wait to get started.\" Chancellor Ronnie Green welcomed Rhule to Nebraska and congratulated Alberts on a laser-focused and strategic search intended to deliver long-term success for Husker student-athletes and program fans. \"(Alberts) made an outstanding choice in Coach Rhule. All of UNL welcomes Matt and the Rhule family to the one and only Big Red,\" Green tweeted. \"Looking forward to your leadership.\"  He’s made an outstanding choice in Coach Rhule. All of @UNLincoln welcomes Matt & the Rhule family to the one & only Big Red. Looking forward to your leadership. #GBR — Ronnie D.", "At Baylor, Rhule posted one win in his first season in 2017, then gained a 7-6 record in 2018. He marked an 11-3 record in his final season with the Bears in 2019, including a trip to the Big 12 Championship game. Rhule made the move to the NFL in 2020, where he coached the Carolina Panthers until October 2022, when he was fired for a lackluster start to the season. He has roots in the Big Ten as a former linebacker for Penn State. Rhule said he's looking forward to focusing on the college game again. \"It is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,\" he said. \"When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football, Nebraska is right at the top of the list.  The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. My family and I are so grateful to become a part of the Husker Family, and we can't wait to get started.\" NU's athletic director called it a privilege to invite the seasoned coach and his family to the Cornhusker state. \"Coach Rhule has created a winning culture throughout his coaching career, and he will provide great leadership for the young men in our football program,\" Trev Alberts said.", "\"Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.\" Rhule is taking the helm following the firing of Scott Frost and the promotion of Mickey Joseph as interim coach. Each of those announcements occurred on September 11 – the day after Nebraska lost to Georgia Southern. Joseph is the first Black head coach in the history of Husker Athletics. In the news release Saturday, Alberts made no mention of what would happen to Joseph. Frost was fired because of his 16-31 record as the coach, Alberts said at the announcement back in September. Starting in 2018, Frost coached four seasons and also three games this year before getting fired. Frost’s buyout provides him $15 million. Trev Alberts said Joseph would have a chance to win the full-time job but that he also would conduct a national search. Rhule is taking on a team that has had little to celebrate in recent seasons. Nebraska hasn’t made a bowl game since 2016, which is the longest drought among teams in the nation’s five biggest conferences. Alberts previously said following the announcement of Frost’s firing that expectations may be lower. “We will stop talking about championships or stop talking about things we used to do,” he said.", "His final season at Baylor included 11 regular season wins, a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game and a New Year’s Six Bowl appearance.  Then came a less stellar NFL stint that ended after an 11-27 record in two-and-a-half seasons. It’s unclear what the exact contract details are as the Panthers owe over $40 million in buyout money. It’s also unclear what the hire means for interim head coach Mickey Joseph and Nebraska’s assistants.  Rhule will have a tall task ahead of him. Neither of the last two head coaches in Lincoln left with a winning record, and no coach has left on his own volition since Tom Osborne retired 25 years ago. The Huskers just wrapped up a 4-8 season and have not had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2016.  But the financial resources, fan support, brand and facilities are in place to be competitive toward the top of the Big Ten. “It is a tremendous honor to be chosen to lead the Nebraska Football program,” Rhule said in a release. “When you think of great, tradition-rich programs in college football Nebraska is right at the top of the list.  The fan base is second to none, and I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to coach in Memorial Stadium on Tom Osborne Field. sports@dailynebraskan.com Senior Sports Editor   Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Zoom’s stock took an additional hit on Nov. 30, when it reported its Q3 2021 earnings.

The bailout was approved last year as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill that was ostensibly meant to combat COVID-19 but included an impressive array of spending that had nothing to do with public health. The bailout will direct funds to more than 200 nearly insolvent multiemployer pension plans, which are established jointly by unions and the private companies that contract with them through collective bargaining agreements. \"With today's actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve,\" Biden told the cheering crowd at a Cleveland high school.

If you're not part of that select club, there's no bailout coming your way—even as a sagging economy eats into private retirement savings, inflation makes every saved dollar worth less, and Social Security looms on the brink of insolvency.

All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).  The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007.[73][74] In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.", "Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Suárez controversially handled the ball on the line.  The Netherlands qualified for the final for the third time with a 3–2 win over Uruguay. Spain reached their first ever final with a 1–0 victory over Germany. As a result, it was the first World Cup final not to feature at least one of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina.  Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to secure third place. Germany holds the record for most third-place finishes in the World Cup (4), while Uruguay holds the record for most fourth-place finishes (3).  The final was held on 11 July 2010 at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with an extra time goal from Andrés Iniesta. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116').[88] The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958,[89] and the first team to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.[68]  A large number of fouls were committed in the final match.", "The continent’s representatives would have to punch above their weight in Qatar as no African nation has made it past the last-eight of the World Cup. There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated. They were ultimately undone by fatigue and a golden goal, but that success launched the mainstream appeal of Senegalese football.", "So one reason Africa is yet to win a World Cup is that it has barely been participating. Some might point to poor results in the last 12 years, but who is to say that increased participation would not have led to increased competition and improvement?  The prize money for simply participating in the World Cup could have been injected into grassroots football around the continent, significantly improving the quality of play. Nearly a century after the inaugural World Cup was hosted in Uruguay, Africa will finally be awarded a more equitable number of places, when we will have 9.5 places in 2026 - inching us a bit closer to global parity. The 2022 World Cup has also shown us that a lack of representation, not only in the form of qualification slots, but also in the form of hosting rights, can be extremely influential.  South Korea made the semi-finals in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament, while the Black Stars of Ghana were a penalty-kick away from the semi-finals in 2010 in Africa's first World Cup in South Africa.  Is it merely a coincidence that Africa and Asia's best ever finishes came the only time the continents have hosted the tournaments? The 2022 World Cup has shown us that the answer is: probably not.  Three Asian sides qualified for the knockout stages this year, and the Qatar World Cup has been, by far, the most successful tournament ever on the pitch for African countries.", "1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion. Cameroon became the first African side to make the last eight in Italy in 1990. They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union. They then beat Colombia 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16, with a 38-year-old Milla scoring a brace to sink the South Americans. With the continent in dreamland, the Indomitable Lions took on England in the quarter-finals. David Platt scored for England in the first half, before Emmanuel Kunde equalised from the spot in the 61st minute. Four minutes later Eugene Ekeke gave Cameroon the lead and the world was 25 minutes from a first African semi-finalist. However, Gary Lineker equalised from the penalty spot and then won it in extra time with another penalty. Cameroon were out but had taken a continent on the journey of a lifetime.

ESPN spoke to both a school president and athletic director on Tuesday who reiterated one of this obvious legacies from Emmert's tenure -- being the NCAA president is not a coveted job. Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert.

That's the key question in assembling a list of candidates to replace Emmert, who announced Tuesday that he's resigning effective June 2023. The NCAA he is leaving behind is in a bit of shambles. There must be some certainty before the next leader evaluates what they are getting into.  That's why it's probably wise to have a lengthy timeline. The NCAA is in the middle of reconstructing its constitution. The association is losing its grip on the FBS. The next president may literally be a glorified liaison to Congress. Point being: if Congress has oversight over name, image and likeness, it isn't going to stop there.  Emmert's successor cannot be bogged down in minutiae. Running the NCAA in the future will have to be about appeasing the Power Five. If not, those schools have the means to break off on their own.

In other words, the company knew that tracking was overinflated. “We’ve got a terrific movie that is playing across all demographics and (has) terrific word of mouth,” said Tony Chambers, the Walt Disney Co.’s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. “We’ve got the screens and we’ve got a clear run. This isn’t about the opening day or the opening weekend. This is about the entire run.” The film began its international rollout on Wednesday and debuted in North America on Thursday evening. Domestically, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was released in 4,202 theaters on over 12,000 screens, 400 of which were IMAX 3D. The studio and filmmakers bet big on the draw, and higher prices, of the 3D format and premium large screens.  By the end of Friday, “Avatar: The Way of Water” had already earned $53 million in the U.S. and Canada and $180.", "Lucky for “The Way of Water” (though maybe not so lucky for theater owners), there’s not much competition through the rest of the year. However, its daunting 192-minute runtime could intimidate people from wanting to watch the movie again and again.  \tTurnout for “Avatar 2” was especially strong on Imax and 3D screens, with 62% of ticket sales coming from premium formats. Globally, the film made $48.8 million from Imax alone, registering as the company’s second-biggest weekend ever and highest December opening in history.  \t“As excited as we are about these early results, we anticipate a long and successful run for ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ as more people around the world book their ticket to Pandora for the epic storytelling and unmissable visual splendor of what James Cameron and his team have created,” says Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax.  \tGiven the hype around Cameron’s grand return to Pandora, rival studios opted to lay low so holdover titles rounded out the rest of box office charts. Another Disney blockbuster sequel, Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” slid to second place after five weeks at the No. 1 spot. The superhero epic added $5.3 million from 3,380 theaters, bringing its domestic tally to $418 million. The movie has grossed $367 million internationally and $786.5 million worldwide.", "IMAX and premium large format (PLF) made up nearly one third of the highly produced movie’s ticket sales on Thursday and Friday, Deadline reported. Avatar: The Way of Water, which has been years in production, received two Golden Globes nominations earlier this week, for best drama film and best director. Reviews have generally been positive, with viewers giving it a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while critics on the site give it a 78%. It also has a 69/100 review from critics and a 71/100 general review on Metacritic, and posted a score of 8.2/10 on IMDb. Earlier this week, the Hollywood Reporter called the sequel “monumental,” and said it “justifies its three-hours-plus of screen time and its mammoth financial investment,” although Variety was less favorable in its review, criticizing the movie for having “almost zero dimensionality to the characters,” while The Guardian dubbed it a “trillion-dollar screensaver.” $400 million. That’s how much Avatar: The Way of Water reportedly cost to produce. Cameron told GQ last month it needs to be the “third or fourth highest grossing film in history” in order to break even. The first Avatar movie grossed over $2.", "The true measure of box office success for James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water was always going to come down to how well the film would hold as it entered its second and third weekends in the market. After opening with the #37 highest-earning debut frame of all-time in the domestic market, the sequel held on with the #30 sophomore frame, and has just finished the New Year’s corridor with the fourth-highest tally for a film in its third weekend.  Last weekend, 20th Century Studios’ sci-fi sequel Avatar: The Way of Water dropped -53% in its sophomore frame to $63.3M. That more than doubled the combined debuts of its three new Christmas weekend competitors, all of which fell below expectations. Now in its third frame, the film increases <1% to $63.4M, easily holding onto third place.

Top overseas totals to date include: So far, the film has earned 69.", "James Cameron’s highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water earned $53 million in its opening day release in the U.S., almost double the opening day success of its blockbuster predecessor, although it’s only the sixth-best film opening this year, and Cameron needs it to be a huge blockbuster to justify its nine-figure budget. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' made $53 million in its opening day release. The Disney and 20th Century Studios sequel to 2009’s Avatar—the highest-grossing film of all time—opened in more than 4,200 theaters this weekend, collecting $17 million in Thursday previews and another $36 million on Friday, Variety reported—nearly double the $26.7 million the first Avatar made on its opening day. Deadline projects it to make between $130 million and $150 million domestically this weekend, short of the $150 million to $170 million it had been projected to make. It falls short of the initial success of four Marvel and DC Comics sequels released earlier this year: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which made $90.7 on its opening day, as well as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($84.2 million), Thor: Love and Thunder ($69.5 million) and The Batman (56.6 million).

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

The new movie(s) is described as an epic sci-fi adventure compared with Star Wars in scope and scale. Here’s an updated look at what we can expect from Rebel Moon which is now confirmed to arrive on Netflix in December 2023. Zack Snyder will direct and co-write the film and will reunite with many of his colleagues from past projects. The script for Rebel Moon will be co-written by Shay Hatten, who co-wrote Army of the Dead, and Kurt Johnstad, who worked on 300 with Snyder.  The Stone Quarry is the main production company behind the movie with Grand Electric also listed, which is Eric Newman’s production company that has an overall deal with Netflix.

Here’s everything else we know about Zack Snyder’s and Netflix’s Rebel Moon: The Hollywood Reporter has revealed the story synopsis for Netflix’s Rebel Moon: The story is set in motion when a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy is threatened by the armies of a tyrannical regent named Balisarius. Desperate, the colonists dispatch a young woman with a mysterious past to seek out warriors from neighboring planets to help them make a stand. As revealed, the movie is heavily inspired by Star Wars and used to be a Star Wars pitch a decade ago. Additional plot information for the movie was released in November 2021: “The film is set in a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy that finds itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius. They dispatch a young woman with a mysterious past to seek out warriors from neighboring planets to help them take a stand the Tyrant.", "From whence shall our help come? Streaming powerhouse Netflix will be teaming up with Zack Snyder after the unprecedented success of his movie Army of the Dead.  After Zack’s lengthy run at Warner Bros and DC, he's found a new home with the streaming service promising an array of exciting new projects. His next film Rebel Moon has been touted to be an epic two-parter with the likelihood of spin-off properties. A lifelong Star Wars fan, Snyder initially intended Rebel Moon as a Star Wars movie. He had the idea to pitch Rebel Moon as a more mature take on the universe created by George Lucas. That idea was shut down after Walt Disney Co. acquired LucasFilm in 2012. Snyder then set up a deal with Deborah Snyder’s production company Stone Quarry and Netflix for Rebel Moon to be reworked into an entirely new universe. Rebel Moon represents a slight shift for Zack Snyder into a distinct sci-fi subgenre that is set in a peaceful colony on the border of a faraway galaxy. The one-time peaceful colony faces an existential threat from the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius. Residents of the colony in a bid to repel this great evil send out a young female dispatch rider named Kora who has a checkered past to solicit the help of different warriors from neighboring planets. Below are all the details regarding the cast, trailer, release date, plot, and everything we know so far for the upcoming sci-fi fantasy.", "A young woman is then sent out to assemble a team of warriors from neighboring planets who can help them fight back. Rebel Moon is clearly a big deal for Netflix, which is on the hunt for more homegrown franchises to line up alongside Stranger Things and The Witcher in the ongoing battle for streaming supremacy. Snyder himself told the Hollywood Reporter, \"my hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.\" On top of the previously mentioned Rebel Moon sequel, Forbes say an RPG videogame may also be on the cards, while extended, R-rated versions of both confirmed Rebel Moon movies are seemingly on the way (via SlashFilm). Space opera designed exclusively for grown-ups? That's a surefire way to put some clear space between Rebel Moon and the veteran, family-friendly franchise that inspired it. Netflix isn't usually in the habit of showing off its wares half a year ahead of release, so it's still a little early for a full Rebel Moon trailer.

It has been ranked among television's best shows in publications such as Entertainment Weekly,[4] Rolling Stone[5] and TV Guide.[6][7] Its most renowned episodes include \"The Chinese Restaurant\", \"The Soup Nazi\", \"The Parking Garage\",[8] \"The Marine Biologist\" and \"The Contest\".[9] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America voted it the No. 2 Best-Written TV Series of All Time (second to The Sopranos).[10] E!", "None of “Jerry’s” (who I believe they actually call Larry since nobody involved in this wants to be sued into the ground) stand-up bits are funny, which makes the silence and occasional miss-timed laugh track even funnier, but I did have a few moments of genuine laughter. There was a moment when “Jerry’s” talking about how the grocery story isn’t a great place to hear celebrity gossip. He said something like how it’s difficult to get juicy details while you’re picking up a carton of eggs. There’s a brief beat of silence before the laugh track kicks in, and I guffawed wondering if the AI put that laugh track there because it knows egg prices are absurd right now. There’s another bit where “Elaine” talks about how the city’s passing an ordinance against jaywalking and how she’ll never get anywhere in the city anymore. I don’t understand why, but I laughed along with the laugh track. AI programs are doing a lot these days, up to and including my very job. I’ve never seen an episode of Seinfeld, so I can’t vouch for whether or not an AI can faithfully reproduce what people tell me is one of the all-time great television shows. But the only thing that seems missing is that iconic funky baseline, which I imagine is hard to play if you have 37 fingers.", "The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.", "The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI’s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious, and sometimes, oddly terrifying."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

However, the specific amount is not provided in the document.", "docs": ["CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - The number of Iowans applying for an Educational Savings Account under Iowa’s new school voucher program has surpassed projections, raising questions on the costs to state taxpayers and local school districts. As of Friday, the Iowa Department of Education says it has received 15,538 applications for an Educational Savings Account, or ESA, to provide state funding for a student to attend a private K-12 school. A Legislative Services Agency analysis projected 14,068 would enroll in the first year of the program. The application period runs through June 30th, meaning the number of applications will likely continue to grow. If all of those applications are approved, the taxpayer cost for the program would likely exceed the $107 million dollars estimate for this coming school year. It would also likely mean a larger-than-expected loss in funding to public schools due to students enrolling instead in a private institution. State funding to public schools is based on enrollment, so fewer enrolled students would mean less funding from the state. Governor Reynolds’ voucher program aimed to offset at least some of that by giving districts $1,176 per student who lives in a district and enrolls in a private school. The state declined to provide demographic data on the applications so far, citing the ongoing application period. That means it’s unclear yet how many of the applications are from public school students.", "Since the law was signed, some private schools have raised their tuition and Holy Family Catholic Schools in Dubuque reported an increase in applications since Governor Reynolds signed the school voucher law. There is no limit on the number of students who can enroll for an ESA but there are limits in the first two years on who can enroll for an ESA. Any student not previously enrolled in a private school is eligible for an ESA for enrolling in a private school. For students already enrolled in a private school, families earning less than 3 times the poverty level, which equals $83,250 for a family of 4, would also be eligible. That increases to 4 times the poverty level for the 2024-25 school year and removes any restrictions on eligibility after that school year. Copyright 2023 KCRG. All rights reserved.", "Ron Robinson, Iowa’s Legislative Service Agency specialist on the bill, said that in order to apply for one of the vouchers, a student’s family must be 400 percent below poverty level, or have an Individualized Education Plan.  To pay for this, $55.2 million would be moved from Iowa’s general fund — the state’s main operating fund. Each student who uses a voucher would receive roughly $5,500, which is 70 percent of that state’s per pupil allocation, Robinson said. The bill passed the Iowa Senate 31-18 on March 30 and has moved to the House.  We cannot gauge whether “the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” because that is a prediction. But Robinson confirmed Konfrst’s statement that 2 percent of Iowa’s K-12 children will have a chance at vouchers. Only 10,000 vouchers would be available for about 485,000 school children in Iowa, he said.  However, other student funding generated from taxes and federal funds will remain in the district that the student leaves. According to the governor’s fact sheet, public schools will retain roughly $1,400 per pupil in property tax dollars for each student from that particular school district who uses a voucher to attend a private school. After the Senate vote, Gov. Kim Reynolds sent a news release that said the state should create opportunities for more families to provide their children with the education choice best for them.", "The Iowa Senate passed SF 2369, and Democratic Rep.

Since then, lawmakers took another step toward that goal when the Iowa Senate passed a school voucher bill known as SF 2369, the Putting Students First Act. Prior to passing the bill, House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, sent a press release condemning the legislation. She said the voucher bill would hurt more students than it helps.  “If the bill is approved, only 2% of Iowa students would benefit while the rest of Iowa kids in public schools would end up losing opportunities,” Konfrst said in the press release.  SF 2369 would create 10,000 vouchers to use for parents in the area to transfer their kids from their local public school to a private school of their choice.", "The Students First Act, introduced by Governor Reynolds and signed into law on Jan. 24, 2023, makes state funding available to support the success of every K-12 student in Iowa. The bill establishes a framework and funding for education savings accounts (ESAs), which may be used by eligible families to cover tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses at accredited nonpublic schools in Iowa.

That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.

And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious. Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.” About how many people are using the product? Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now. Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform? Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license. How was the dataset built? It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky.", "So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.", "As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

It’s still early days for this kind of A.I., they said, and it’s too early to predict the downstream consequences of putting this technology in billions of people’s hands. “With any new technology, you don’t perfectly forecast all of the issues and mitigations,” Mr. Altman said. “But if you run a very tight feedback loop, at the rate things are evolving, I think we can get to very solid products very fast.” For now, only one thing seems clear: After years of stagnation and stasis, Microsoft and OpenAI have made search interesting again.

Information Design.[27]  Microsoft contended that claims challenging its trademark were without merit because these companies filed for U.S. federal trademark applications only after Microsoft filed for the Bing trademark in March 2009.[28]  In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users.", "today to try sample queries and sign up for the waitlist.

Silbermann, who co-founded the company in 2010 and took it public in April 2019, will serve as the company's first Executive Chairman. Silbermann faced challenges ranging from missed quarterly user expectations to a series of workforce complaints, including two Black former Pinterest employees whose public claims of discrimination and retaliation became the basis of a California workforce non-disclosure law. \"As someone who has spent most of my career in commerce and payments, it's so clear to me that Pinterest has the opportunity to build something unique—something special,\" Ready said in a LinkedIn post.

The Pikmin 4 reveal trailer was brief and didn’t give us much information outside of a general look at its art and some environments. But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

Outside of the new Pikmin types, Oatchi will be a major gameplay addition. Aside from being able to fight for you, he will have new abilities you can unlock and upgrade, such as riding him in water and having him break through obstacles in the world. Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once. With Pikmin 4 utilizing the power of the Switch, more Pikmin than ever can appear on screen, but that doesn't mean you can just grind out an entire army right off the bat.", "This fourth entry has been a long time coming, with Shigeru Miyamoto saying back in 2015 that it was “very close to completion.” Seven years later, it’s finally set to release in July. This installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles. Overall, it looks like good fun for fans of the series or anyone interested in picking up a colorful, cartoonish strategy game. Check out our Pikmin 4 review for more details.

The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience medical students or physicians?", "Does the audience have a clinical background or are they non-clinical? All of these factors matter when teaching a class.  Whether your learners are baby llamas or adult llamas, you can invest energy in examples and training types that are right for them. Everyone will get more out of the experience.  The llamas aren’t hiking all the time, every day. They don’t do tours in the off-season. So every year, they have to retrain to break down bad habits they’ve developed when they aren’t hanging out with humans every day. The trainers don’t expect llamas to learn it once and remember it forever. We shouldn’t expect that from humans either. Learning is continuous. While right after training, everyone may be very aware of what they are doing and very careful to do it correctly, as time passes we become more comfortable. We might forget what we’ve learned. New challenges may change what we do. That’s why we need to train continuously and retrain when something changes or a lot of time has passed. Everyone needs a refresher now and then to deliver a reliable experience.  They set up every llama for a great, successful hike. If a llama isn’t good with kids, they don’t pair that llama with a kid. In the case of my hike, they gave my son a more experienced, no-drama llama, but gave me a llama with less experience.", "The Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) released Alpaca, a training recipe based on the LLaMA 7B model that uses the \"Self-Instruct\" method of instruction tuning to acquire capabilities comparable to the OpenAI GPT-3 series text-davinci-003 model at a modest cost.[21][22] Multiple open source projects are[when?] continuing this work of finetuning LLaMA with Alpaca dataset.[23]", "GET 60% OFF OUTSIDE+                                 One Subscription to Fuel All Your Adventures                                   SUBSCRIBE NOW                        Create a personalized feed and bookmark your favorites.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.", "Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I’d never done before.  So we went on a two-hour llama hike.  When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The game will be broadcasted on ACCNX. The Hokies finished 2022 with an overall record of 3-8, going 1-6 in conference play.

Despite a 34-0 scoreline - the format of the Spring Game can be beneficial to some players and detrimental to others. Ultimately, the glorified scrimmage is an opportunity to see the latest developments with key personnel, while also affording a chance for younger players to get their opportunity to play in front of the fans in Lane Stadium. Things will likely change a lot more before the next time we see the team play and it's best to acknowledge the developments on the field, while understanding that the offseason spectacle is purely entertainment.  © 2005-2023 CBS INTERACTIVE ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Presented by    Big plays were in short supply last year for the Hokies. Points, too. You don’t break offensive futility records from 30 or more years ago unless you’ve got issues, a reason Virginia Tech went so hard in the transfer portal for skill guys this offseason. It was only the spring game Saturday, which comes with its usual caveats, but the Hokies appeared to have a deeper roster of play-makers show up in the Maroon team’s 34-0 blanking of the White team in Lane Stadium. Running backs Chance Black and Bryce Duke combined for 152 yards, with Black finding the end zone twice. Tucker Holloway’s three catches for 77 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown in the third quarter, paced a revamped receiver room that has more options. Overall, the Hokies had seven plays go for 20 or more yards Saturday, following up a dismal 2022 season when they averaged just 3.5 such plays per game, among the fewest in the country. “We needed that,” Hokies head coach Brent Pry said. “Everybody has those playmakers.

BLACKSBURG — Once last year’s football season came to an end, Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry said the plan in his second year with the Hokies was to upgrade the talent level in the offensive skill positions. Saturday’s spring football game at Lane Stadium was the first time Virginia Tech’s fans got a good glimpse of where things are at in that category. And while some of those new faces may not have been in the spotlight, their impact was evident in what the Hokies were getting out of some of their returning wide receivers and running backs. There was progress, Pry said, although most of that was only seen on the Maroon side of the football.", "The Virginia Tech Hokies wrapped up their Spring portion of the off-season with the 2023 Annual Spring Game.

It was the first chance for thousands of fans to watch the 2023 Virginia Tech Hokies in a simulated game atmosphere. The contest resulted in a lop-sided affair, won by Team Maroon over Team White, with a final score of 34-0. Here are five takeaways from the action we saw on the field on Saturday:  1. Quarterback Competition is far from over as Wells and Drones continue to battle it out There was never going to be a definitive answer exiting the Spring Game, but we all got the chance to see the development of Grant Wells and the capabilities of Kyron Drones at the quarterback position. Wells finished 12-of-18 for 148 passing yards (66.7%) and a TD. He had 3 rushes for 10 yards and a rushing touchdown. Notably, Wells threw 6 passes that were gains of 16-or-more yards. The incumbent starter mostly linked up with the Gosnell brothers (Stephen and Benji) and Tucker Holloway. Wells executed his plays and limited the risky elements of his playstyle. It also helps that he inherited the more stable offensive line, which once again benefited his performance."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India. And it has done it with Apple,\" Mr Roy says.", "And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren’t helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself — and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail. “I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly — who does that?” Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. “I don’t see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future.” India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India’s, has two. But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India’s. In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company’s market share in India has been growing rapidly.", "Production was disrupted last year at Apple's biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a Covid outbreak and worker protests. That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn. Wedbush's Ives said Apple's India strategy — with both a retail and manufacturing push — mirrors the technology giant's steps it took in the China market 10 years ago. \"As Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,\" Ives said. \"Rome was not built overnight and neither will Apple's broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.\" Correction: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of Dan Ives.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.", "“Some of the responses were so absurd that they ended up being funny, but not in the way the app likely intended.” He said he doesn’t plan on using the app again. “I anticipate that I’ll continue these conversations manually,” Lloyd said.", "area who recently graduated with a degree in sports business, has been using Your Move to start conversations on Hinge and Bumble. “Before I was like, ‘Tell me about yourself, what do you do,’ et cetera,” he said. “This helped me explore the personality of someone a little better. Today, I used it, and one of the things it said to ask was, ‘What’s your favorite dinosaur?’ It’s such a basic thing to ask, but it shows personality.” Miranda Green, a 33-year-old climate reporter in Los Angeles, said Your Move has made dating apps more enjoyable. “I think it kept me from having these monotonous-sounding conversations and made things actually engaging,” she said. Green said multiple men with whom she matched complimented her conversational skills and ability to ask thoughtful questions. One even asked her out after she sent the first AI-generated message. “Wow, there’s so much to be said about that,” her match had replied. “It kind of made me feel a little bit like an impostor, but also it kept me from just saying kind of the same thing over and over again, and clearly it worked,” she said. “I actually had a guy say to me, ‘I was trying to think of a winning thing to say to you and you beat me to the punch.", "What I will call a success is when people are proud to use Keys to communicate because it means you’re working on yourself to be a better communicator.” Some users aren’t just using AI for messaging; they’re also leveraging AI tools to optimize themselves in every feature of a dating app. Dax Flame, 31, a content creator in Los Angeles, began an experiment this year to let AI run every aspect of his life while he documented the journey on YouTube. “I used ChatGPT to help me with a bio on Tinder and message the first matches I got,” he said. “I asked for the ideal bio. Some of the aspects didn’t fit me, but it felt nice and conversational. Eventually, I asked for a more personalized version, and that one was a little bit better. I cut out the guitar strummer part because I don’t play guitar.” Your Move also recently rolled out a feature that helps generate the perfect dating app profile. Slate writer Heather Tal Murphy also turned to ChatGPT to land dates for a friend on the dating apps Tinder and Bumble. “ChatGPT encouraged an odd strain of forwardness that was helpful in getting the dates set up quickly,” Tal Murphy wrote. are you not impressed? because I am https://t.co/uWLchKL432 pic.twitter.com/7fHtYWEEDq Suman Kanuganti, the founder of Personal.", "Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison. Speaking to WaPo, he explained that he's always had a difficult time reading social cues — a dating stressor that a tool like YourMove.ai helps to alleviate. \"There's such a gap currently,\" he told the newspaper, \"in what people like myself want to communicate and how it comes across.\" That's sympathetic, in a sense, and we could see how AI assistance might benefit folks who have a tough time socially. At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity?

The twin moves have all sorts of implications for the federation, particularly as it relates to the vacant USMNT coaching job. Here are four key questions for the fed following the news. Who replaces Earnie Stewart, Brian McBride?   On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone indicated that McBride’s position might not be filled at all.  \"We're going to evaluate the entire sporting department, and that includes the [men’s] GM role,\" Parlow Cone said. \"We're not dead set on having the exact same structure on the men's side as we do have on the women's side, and we're going to be evaluating that and seeing what changes we need to make.\" When it comes to Stewart’s replacement, there are few obvious candidates.", "CHICAGO (Aug. 12, 2019) – U.S. Soccer has appointed three-time FIFA World Cup veteran Earnie Stewart to be the first Sporting Director of U.S. Soccer and Kate Markgraf, who played in six world championships for the USA, winning the 1999 Women's World Cup and two Olympic gold medals, as the first General Manager of the Women’s National Team. As the Sporting Director, Stewart will oversee U.S. Soccer’s entire Sports Performance Department, including the men’s and women’s senior and youth National Team programs, to create a more streamlined structure, align the overall technical approach and ensure greater communication and sharing of best practices within Federation programs. Reporting directly to the CEO, Stewart will also oversee all other Sports Performance departments, including Talent Identification, High Performance and Analytics. This framework will lead to enhanced player development, more clearly defined pathways through the National Teams pyramid and help drive the ultimate goal, which is winning championships with the senior teams. At the same time, efforts to increase participation in the sport overall will be aided through his influence on coaching education, referee training and club development. “This is a great day for the Federation and for soccer in America,\" said U.S. Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro. “In Earnie Stewart and Kate Markgraf, we’re keeping our commitment to ensure that soccer operations are run by soccer experts.", "Anthony Hudson is currently serving as an interim but has repeatedly said he’s not looking for the full-time gig.

Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role.

Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program.

But now, as U.S. Soccer's leaders conduct what they are calling \"a global search\" for Stewart's successor, they have also changed the job description. President Cindy Parlow Cone said Saturday that the new sporting director, whom they expect to hire before July's Women's World Cup, will \"really focus on our national teams ... and our technical plan at the elite level.\" They have essentially split Stewart's job — which \"was huge,\" Parlow Cone said — into two. They will create a new position to oversee the broader landscape. That new executive, who will report to CEO JT Batson, will focus on everything from coaching education to referee development, and on \"growing youth and adult participation,\" Batson said.

I wanted her to stay true to herself as a DP. She loves to go handheld. She loves it to feel a little bit bursting at the seams. There’s a wildness and a freedom to the way she shoots. It was just a thrill to get to work with her. Prepping with Ashley is the most fun ever; we just swap film references, watch lots of films, and constantly remind each other of the films that are inspiring us as we shoot. We’re like, “70’s Scorsese! It can be a bit out of focus.” We were looking at Park Chan-wook’s movies, his Vengeance Trilogy being both stylized but also fizzing. It’s not overly stylized, there’s a vibrancy of movement within the frame, and we wanted to bring that to it. It was just constantly back and forth, sharing references, and having a really great time.   Polite Society is playing in theaters nationwide.", "With two unique stories under her belt, Manzoor talked to EW about what inspired her first film and who her biggest influences are as a storyteller. Polite Society is a mix of thrilling action sequences and comedy, so it's no surprise that one of Manzoor's biggest influences is Jackie Chan. \"I love watching Jackie Chan movies,\" shares Manzoor. \"As a kid, I thought his mix of comedy and martial arts was something that got me excited about cinema.\" The director fondly remembers going to see Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour and being blown away by not only how funny it was but that the big-screen comedy starred people of color. The 1998 classic was her gateway to Chan's other work, including Police Story and Drunken Master.  Bollywood spectacles have also had a real impact on Manzoor's work. \"I grew up on a very heavy diet of Bollywood movies,\" she says of the weekly trips she took to the cinema with her mother growing up. One of her favorites is the 2002 film Devdas, based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1917 novel about a law graduate who returns to London to marry his childhood friend. \"That film stands out because I was so impressed with the filmmaker,\" she shares. \"I feel like we sometimes look down on Bollywood cinema in the West and I remember being so moved by the craft of that film in particular.", "When Manzoor looks at her Bollywood influences, one person who comes to mind is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The popular actress served as an inspiration for the character of Ria in Polite Society. Rai Bachchan — who has starred in films such as Jeans, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and Devdas — is a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and Manzoor admires her body's agility and strength, which also influences Ria's dream to become a stunt performer.  Seeing Jordan Peele's game-changing horror flick Get Out — which put Black actors center stage and was infused with social commentary — convinced Manzoor that Polite Society could one day end up on the big screen, too. \"I remember feeling the audience respond to [Get Out] and thinking maybe there was a place for my film,\" she recalls. Peele's use of humor in the 2017 movie also taught Manzoor something very important: \"I didn't realize how much you could use comedy to help keep the audience with you.\" Kill Bill is one of the many films to inspire the action sequences in Polite Society. There is a fight that takes place between Ria and her sister Lena, which is gritty and more grounded than some of the other bigger battle scenes in the movie. It take inspiration from the Bourne films and the Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah brawl in Kill Bill.", "Even as Lena and Salim’s courtship appears headed to the altar, Salim is still creepily tied to the apron strings of his mysterious mother, Raheela (Nimra Bucha). It’s a good thing Ria has the loyal, all-in support of her besties Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) and Clara (Seraphina Beh), who have her back no matter how crazy things get.  As the story unfolds, audiences are treated to extravagant fight scenes, tight action sequences, and a showstopping Bollywood dance number, all filtered through the experience of one girl coming of age. As such, the script doesn’t shy away from female rage and issues around identity, making the film a unique delight for viewers who’ve rarely seen themselves reflected onscreen.  Manzoor discussed Polite Society with The Credits, pointing to her influences and revealing how her collaborations were integral to making this unusual genre-bending film successful on so many levels.    Polite Society is a love note to your favorite genre movies growing up. Some films mentioned as inspiration are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix, and the Bollywood classic, Devdas. What specific moments might be a callback only fans of those films would recognize?", "Manzoor lists directors Mira Nair (The Namesake) and Deepa Mehta (Elements trilogy) as two people who inspire her, since they feature South Asian women in their projects. \"It made me believe that our stories are worth being told,\" Manzoor says, noting that she also looks up to Pedro Almodóvar. \"He centered women in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\" Tamara Jenkins' 1998 debut film Slums of Beverly Hills, which is about a teenage girl struggling to grow up in a lower-middle-class nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months, made Manzoor feel seen as a teenager. \"Each of her movies expresses a real truth of womanhood and there's a rawness to her work that I gravitate to,\" she explains. In addition to Slums of Beverly Hills, Jenkins directed The Savages and Private Life. Since Manzoor is focused on telling women-centric tales, it makes sense that Jane Austen's works have always resonated with her. \"There's something in the way she explores the pressure of society and being a woman who wants to strike out on her own,\" she says.  Polite Society is in theaters now."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

RELATED: 2023 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming  \tStarring Echo Kellum, Justin Cunningham, Grasie Mercedes, Carl Tart, Aaron Jennings and Nicole Byer, Grand Crew hails from writer-producer Phil Augusta Jackson. Dan Goor also executive produces.  \t           Grand Crew revolves around a group of Black friends who unpack the ups and downs of life and love at a wine bar.   RELATED: ‘Young Rock’ Canceled By NBC After 3 Seasons  \tSeason 2 averaged about 1.2M viewers and a 0.18 rating among the 18-49 demographic, according to live + same-day Nielsen data. That’s a fairly significant dip from the 1.6M average audience and 0.3 rating that the first season drew for the network. The premiere episode was NBC’s top digital comedy launch on Peacock.  \tThe second season premiered in March and its ten episode run ended in April.", "I am not shy about my love for NBC’s sleeper hit hangout sitcom, Grand Crew. Since it premiered within a week of Abbott Elementary in December of 2021, it’s the show I’ve been telling everyone and their cousin to catch up on once they’re up to date with Janine and her fellow Philly teachers. I’ve even gone long on it here in Paste’s digital pages. So it was an immediate YES, then, when the series’ press team reached out to connect me with series creator and showrunner Phil Augusta Jackson in advance of the Season 2 finale. Considering that the last few episodes of the season brought fans the shocking and sad twist that original Crew member Fay (Grasie Mercedes) would be leaving LA to take on managerial duties at a Grand Cru wine bar spin-off out in New York City, this was a call I was more than ready to take. And while the conversation didn’t quite turn to what might be in Grand Crew’s now Fay-less Season 3 future—or even if, indeed, it’s likely to see such a future—it was nevertheless a delight. Enjoy the conversation, and then get back to streaming Season 2! The world deserves as much Grand Crew as Jackson (and NBC) are willing to make.  Note: The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Paste Magazine: So I am really loving Season 2.  Phil Augusta Jackson: Thank you so much. I appreciate that.", "It’s currently on a hiatus and it’s also hard to say when the new season will come back to the NBC as the premiere date hasn’t even yet been confirmed yet online. We’re hopeful that Grand Crew season 2 is currently shooting and the premiere date will be sometime in early 2023. Its regular time slot is 8:30 p.m. EST on Tuesdays. The show might have to compete with upcoming pilots who might compete for its time slot. With that being said, hopefully there isn’t a drastic last-minute change to the 2022-2023 lineup. Other shows to watch out for include American Auto, Young Rock, Quantam Leap, La Brea, and New Amsterdam. And for those of you who haven’t met the crew yet, what are you waiting for?

You can’t destroy this meeting of the media and political elite that primarily only certain people from D.C, L.A., and New York care about. As the performances by President Joe Biden and this year’s Correspondents’ Dinner host Roy Wood, Jr. argued last night, we shouldn’t want to destroy it either. In keeping with tradition, both the president and invited comedian made speeches that concluded an evening reserved, in theory, for honoring the work of journalists and young people who aspire to join the field.

Everyone who considered it outrageous that Huckabee Sanders could be insulted in such a high-profile setting needs to be reminded that she’s now the governor of Arkansas, where so far she’s banned the use of the word “Latinx,” rolled back child labor laws, and recently endorsed koozies lauding the election of “real women,” a blatant attempt to debase the trans community while trolling Bud Light. Everyone concerned that this woman or democracy itself might have been imperiled by assertions that her eye shadow is composed of deceit particles — which it might be, has there been an investigation? — needs to be reminded that it’s okay to lob some honest, revelatory jokes at our leaders, especially when those people engage in behavior that screams to be ridiculed. The White House Correspondents’ Dinner may be a flawed attempt to do that. (One example of its flaws: The terrible sketch featuring the Property Brothers renovating the White House press room.) But it’s a regularly scheduled attempt, and both President Biden and Wood were convincing and funny enough to make it seem like something more meaningful than a prom for D.C.", "In addition to The Daily Show, Wood also has a stand-up special, Imperfect Messenger, on Paramount+.  \tThe 2022 event marked the return of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as a live event, after two years without the event amid the pandemic.

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The rumors are true: next week, Google will introduce its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, during the Google I/O 2023 event.  Google hasn’t revealed any specs for the device, but a brief teaser video shows off a full-size outer display on a phone that opens up similarly to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold devices. The camera bar on the back is similar to other Pixel devices but doesn’t stick out as prominently, reflecting what we’ve seen in leaked marketing materials and even a hands-on video. CNBC reported in April that the Pixel Fold would be a 5.8-inch phone that folds out into a 7.6-inch tablet. It’ll reportedly include a Google Tensor G2 processor, weigh 10 ounces, and have “the most durable hinge on a foldable,” along with a price that’s over $1,700. Samsung’s latest foldable, the Z Fold 4, launched with a price of $1,799. We had expected to see it last year, but the Fold didn’t make the cut for I/O in 2022, and rumors about its launch haven’t slowed down in the year since.", "However, people who secured a pre-order of the Pixel Fold have been noting the shipping date for Google's first folding phone has slipped from june 27 to between July 3 and July 7. This may be an indication that Google underestimated demand for the Pixel Fold.  Speaking of pre-orders, if you opt to get the Google Pixel Fold through AT&T you can save a huge 50%. You'll need to sign up for three years of AT&T service, but doing so reduces the cost of the Pixel Fold to $900.  We asked Google about the Pixel Fold's high price in an interview and the product manager provided some interesting answers.  Google says the Pixel Fold will be available in the U.S., UK, Germany and Japan, at least for now. The Fold will be available through all three major carriers in the U.S. Google Pixel pre-orders include a free Google Pixel Watch, which is valued at $349.  The Google Store may be the best place to get it though, at least in the U.S., thanks to some incredibly generous trade-in bonuses.  Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 4 (and presumably the Z Fold 5), the Pixel Fold unfolds in a book-like fashion to reveal a large 7.6-inch display. But Google's design is actually quite different from what Samsung offers. Google claims that the Pixel Fold has the thinnest profile of any foldable, as it measures just 6.2 x 5.", "Look, I’m not going to sit here and pretend that the entire world didn’t know this was happening next week, but is a bit of theatrics too much to ask? Google learned a few years back that the best way to juice a product hype cycle is to “leak” the thing yourself, and here we are, facing down a tweet that leaves very little to the imagination. The short video shows the company’s upcoming Pixel Fold unfolding slowly from every conceivable angle. Google’s using Star Wars Day as an excuse to fire up the old hype train, but the truth is it’s priming up the pump with less than a week before it returns to Shoreline for an in-person I/O. There were already a LOT of leaks and rumors floating around, so the company just went ahead and took matters into its own hands. There’s also an official Pixel Fold page where you can sign up for news and the like. There’s still some information that hasn’t been made official, including pricing and release date. Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google As seen above, all previous leaks appear to have more or less been on the money. As the name implies, the form factor is more Samsung Galaxy Z Fold than Samsung Galaxy Z Flip — that is, more book than clamshell. The dimensions, on the other hand, appear a bit closer to Oppo’s recent foldable, or even Microsoft’s bygone Surface Duo.", "The Google Fold phone is the first entry to the US folding phone market after Samsung After years of rumors, Google finally unveiled the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023, its first folding phone that goes head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Like Samsung's flagship foldable, the Pixel Fold is a book-style folding phone that has a regular smartphone-like screen on the front and a tablet-like display on the inside. We'll still have to wait a few more weeks until we can get our hands on it, but here is everything Google has announced so far. While Google already announced the Pixel Fold at Google I/O 2023 (and teased it on Twitter beforehand), the Google Pixel Fold will only ship on June 27. This is right in line with some previous hardware releases at I/O, like the Pixel 6a, which was only released to stores after more than a month after the event. If you're convinced the Pixel Fold is for you, you can preorder it right now from the Google Store for $1,800. It's an expensive price, but you'll get a free Pixel Watch as part of pre-purchasing. It was long rumored that Google would try and undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 4 in price, but as we can see now, this isn't the case. The phone is available in a dark Obsidian and a light Porcelain colorway.", "The Google Pixel Fold was in the rumor mill for more than a year, without Google ever acknowledging it's working on it until a few days before Google I/O 2023. With this year's developer conference now out of the way, the cat is finally out of the bag, and we will soon be able to get our hands on Google's first foldable. We can only hope that this brings more foldables from other manufactures to the US, as more competition is always better. Keep your eyes peeled on June 27th if you're looking to pick one up at launch.

But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.", "Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the hardware market.

Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. There’s also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones. A year after announcing the product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The device’s specifications — including the company’s G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design — are by this point dated compared with rival devices. Its price — $499 — also eclipses some iPad models, though the Google device includes a home dock to stand it upright.

With the Pixel 7a, Google mostly stuck to its usual playbook: it took last year’s Pixel 7, kept most of its important guts, made its shell out of cheaper materials, and planned to sell it for less. This time, Google made one surprising change to the formula: it stuck a higher-resolution main camera sensor in the back, so expect slightly more detailed photos. Apart from that, though, this is Google’s attempt at making some of its hallmark Pixel features, like Magic Eraser for photos, smart call screening, and a tool for quickly navigating customer service phone trees available to a wider audience. That may all sound a bit basic, and perhaps it is. But after living with the device for about a week, I never really felt like I was missing out on anything more expensive devices offered.", "6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes — it’s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less.

To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied.

This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories.

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor.

One thing that could be compelling about OpenAI’s mobile app versus search apps’ AI integrations is its ad-free nature.", "You'll now have easy access to ChatGPT from your iPhone. OpenAI announced Thursday it was launching a ChatGPT app.  Basically, the app promises to put the generative AI chatbot in your pocket. \"We're starting our rollout in the US and will expand to additional countries in the coming weeks,\" OpenAI said in a statement. \"We're eager to see how you use the app. As we gather user feedback, we're committed to continuous feature and safety improvements for ChatGPT.\" The app was available for download on the App Store shortly after the announcement.  The app is free to use and will sync your history with ChatGPT across devices. It also uses OpenAI's speech-recognition system Whisper to integrate voice input. Those subscribed to ChatGPT Plus will get all the exclusive Chat GPT-4 capabilities on iOS as well.  The app will certainly make using ChatGPT easier for most folks, since we're constantly on our phones.

The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but it called for a committee of owners and players to discuss further charges.

Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration deadline, which usually falls 10 days before the draft at 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC). Under current NCAA rules, players usually have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.

The Apple Vision Pro headset will reportedly be sold in Apple stores with a fitting appointment.  Apple will initially require customers to make an in-store appointment to buy the $3,500 Vision Pro so the headset can be fitted properly and customers can be taught how to use it, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The headset is designed to wrap around the head and keep out light and the many variables involved in fitting the mask—including multiple head straps, different sized light seals and optional prescription lenses—necessitate the individualized approach, Bloomberg reported. Apple will sell the device at all of its U.S. stores, though the company will reportedly begin the rollout in larger areas like New York and Los Angeles early next year. Bloomberg reports that most stores will only have one or two demo devices due to limited supply and high cost of headsets. The Vision Pro will also go on sale online in its U.S. web store at some point in early 2024, Bloomberg reported, and the complexities of its sale mean the company does not expect to partner with third-party resellers until at least 2025.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio.

Some were shocked just a few weeks ago when Apple execs revealed the Vision Pro's price tag: at $3,500 a pop, the Vision Pro is one of Apple's more expensive consumer products. Cramer noted that some rationalized the steep cost by figuring Apple's Vision Pro would open the doors for less expensive headsets of a similar ilk. But Cramer sees potential for major wireless carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T to capitalize on the new product by offering discounts on plans in exchange for cheaper phones.", "Apple did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. The Vision Pro is Apple’s much anticipated foray into virtual reality and its launch could be as important to the company as its other major products like the iPhone. It is billed as a mixed reality headset that blends the virtual and real world—one can switch between full virtual reality and “augmented” reality mixing virtual and real elements—and has been a poorly kept secret that has been years in the making. Investors hope it will fire up interest in the sector, which has been around for years but struggled to take off in a major way. Its high price tag puts it at the upper end of the market—it is working on a cheaper model—which analysts expect will limit initial demand to loyal Apple fans and wealthier customers. The headset’s design and high costs of the technology it uses have reportedly forced Apple to lower its ambitions for the device’s rollout to manage manufacturing difficulties. The issues have reportedly pushed the company to drop its 2024 production goal from more than 1 million units to fewer than 400,000. Apple will push Vision Pro into other markets toward the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg reports that companies linked to Apple have applied for names including ‘Reality One’, ‘Reality Pro’ and ‘Reality Processor’. Do not expect the headset to appear as part of the iPhone 14 event on September 7 however. The latest rumors generally point to a product launch of the headset early in 2023. Apple’s interest in the ‘Reality’ branding has been known as far back as 2017, when Bloomberg first reported that Apple was working on ‘rOS’ or realityOS. In 2019, Apple published a developer framework named ‘RealityKit’, to help create augmented reality experiences. Of course, there’s no guarantee that Apple uses any of the proposed trademarks, like the Reality One or Reality Pro names. For a start, they haven’t been granted yet. However, you can see the logic. The AR headset would be Apple’s first product in the space, hence Reality One.  Reality Pro is also viable, as the first-generation headset is rumored to be a high-end device — almost like a tech demo more than mass consumer product — with a hefty ~$2000 price tag, if not more. The headset is expected to feature two super high resolution displays, one for each eye, and a bevy of cameras and sensors.", "Apple did not respond to our request for comment. The headset is believed to be the same size as Meta’s Oculus Quest and focused on high-tech and high-performance. Additionally, it’s said to include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive?  The new product will find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as headliners. A sneak peek of the new headset could also be on the agenda, as the company looks to entice developers to create content for the new category. Executives are believed to have already shown off a version of the product to shareholders.", "The Reality Processor would naturally refer to the custom Apple silicon designed for the device. The chip is expected to be similar to the M2 chip seen in the 2022 MacBook Air. The Information said the first-generation headset would also feature a special coprocessor to manage the imaging pipeline. Apple’s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything’s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release. What we do expect to see on September 7 is the iPhone 14 lineup and Apple Watch Series 8. The headset will most likely be announced in the spring of 2023.

N421 is Apple's long-rumored augmented reality glasses device, though Gurman cautioned that it may not launch for some time.

For her, teasing out the narrative in a piece of reporting is a similar skill to finding the right business model to address a market demand. Once you find that signal, you build the product or write the story. After completing Paulson’s memoir, Ryder decamped to Southeast Asia, where she served as a journalist for The Economist and The Wall Street Journal. From there she transitioned into venture capital, another industry where being able to spot the trends with staying power has outsized importance. Her experience on the VC side of the table would come in handy when she would later pitch investors on the idea that would become Maven. As Maven’s business has scaled, Ryder’s storytelling impulses have served her well, whether it’s attracting talent and investors, closing sales, or building a brand identity. All of these functions require Ryder to build a compelling narrative around the need for better healthcare options for women and their families. Finding the Maven Story Ryder’s story for Maven goes like this: When her friends started to have kids, she saw something had to change. Having a child was a monumental event, she believed, affecting a woman’s body, their personal life, and their professional life.", "Among other major partnerships, MassHealth, the Massachusetts, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program partnered with Maven to provide free telemedicine appointments for members experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, enabling them to readily set up remote appointments without exposing providers to infection risk. Maven raised $110 million in August in a Series D financing round, at a valuation at over $1 billion, officially making it the only U.S. unicorn in the women’s and family health sector. Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital co-led the round, along with an added publicity boost of having Oprah Winfrey as a new backer. The company’s unicorn status has left Ryder feeling humbled. “Women’s and family health is wide open. This market is just opening right now and to be able to marry the virtual to the brick-and-mortar to develop this new care model that’s totally seamless for the patient — it’s not going to happen overnight, but we have the opportunity to really steer that, and that’s super exciting.", "Ryder recently told CNBC that the company saw a 67% month-over-month increase in opportunities from companies looking for travel benefits, as well as other health-care support for pregnant women, after the SCOTUS decision. \"Because we're in the market, because we had a platform that we were able to access, we were able to jump up and step up with our products,\" Ryder said at the recent CNBC Work Summit.  Maven Clinic has experienced a broader increase in demand for its products over the past two years amid a pandemic and tight labor market, which she attributed to the accessibility of its virtual platform as well as its outspoken support of health equity. \"The overturning of Roe v. Wade created additional inequities in a system already riddled with them, in a country where 50% of counties don't have an OB-GYN and where maternal mortality rates surpass those of all other developed countries,\" she wrote in the blog post. Maven now reaches 15 million members, a 5x increase from last year, across its 450-plus corporate clients and payers (insurance companies) in over 175 countries, and the platform supports over 30 provider specialties in 30 provider languages.

Sign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders. Ryder has said in the past that her determination to create Maven came partially as a result of her own medical frustration and trauma. A miscarriage left her feeling \"lost, discouraged, and confused why something so painful and physically taxing was considered outside the bounds of traditional healthcare,\" she wrote in a blog post. With the new funding, Ryder said the company needs to be careful about how it scales, but will not be conservative with the cash despite the current economic environment given the need to invest in growth opportunities. \"We're not putting this capital aside for a rainy day,\" she wrote on Monday. Global family benefits growth and Medicaid are two areas that Maven is prioritizing with the new funding. The family benefits will build off of the virtual platform that grew during Covid and include new features for Maven Wallet, the company's financial reimbursement platform. Additional Medicaid expansion requires \"a more localized approach, which must be more deliberate,\" Ryder said, \"but particularly in the aftermath of Roe, the need has never been greater.\" The Maven CEO laid out some more of her strategic thinking after the fundraise in a series of Twitter posts.

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "Every year, Prime Day gets bigger and better, and this year is no exception. For the first time ever, Amazon offered its members invite-only savings. The online store launched a new “Invite-Only Prime Deals” section where subscribers can browse an assortment of discounts that will go live on Prime Day.    In every product listing, members were able to preview the Prime Day sale price and opt in by clicking the “request invite” button. You must be logged into a Prime account to see the button, but non-members can get these exclusive markdowns by signing up for a free 30-day trial of Prime.    Amazon also launched back-to-school and off-to-college storefronts, which featured sections dedicated to deals under $5, under $10, and under $20.    Prime Day is typically a 48-hour event. This year, it began on a Tuesday at midnight PT and will run through Thursday at midnight PT.    While the sale routinely runs over the course of two days, not all deals will last that long. Many of the offers will be available for only 24 hours, and some will last for just a few hours or while supplies last.    All shoppers can head to Amazon.com/deals to browse the complete assortment of Prime Day deals. You’ll need to be signed into a Prime account to ensure that every discount appears when checking out, but don’t let that deter you from deal hunting.", "Prime Day is over, but some of the best deals are still available!

Last year, Amazon held its first-ever Prime Early Access Sale, which was effectively a second Prime Day sale. In 2022, that Prime sale went from 3 a.m. ET on Oct. 11 through midnight on Oct.", "Some early Prime Day price drops are already on the table, with Amazon offering discounts on its own products, including Wirecutter-recommended devices like the Kindle Paperwhite Kids ebook reader and the Echo Dot Kids (5th Gen) Alexa smart speaker.

Prime members get access to some of the better prices available on a variety of stuff, from Amazon’s own selection of smart speakers to housewares, baby gear, laptops, and clothing. There are several ways savvy shoppers can prepare for Prime Day. As in years past, Prime members can once again set up deals alerts based on previous Amazon searches and recently viewed items. Visit the Prime Day event page on the Amazon app between now and Prime Day to create a deals alert, and you’ll receive push notifications when deals become available. Amazon has also rolled out a new, invite-only deals program this year, through which Prime members can request an invitation to score some (so-called) exclusive deals on items that are expected to sell out. We’re waiting to see what these deals entail, but we anticipate seeing discounts on everything from robot vacuums and smart TVs  to exercise equipment and small appliances.", "12.  Now we do not yet have confirmation that Amazon will have another Early Access Sale this year. But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale — and there's no reason to think it won't — you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.  If you missed out on the latest Prime Day, fear not, because retailers likes Walmart and Target have started their own sales to rival Prime Day. And those deals are still for the taking.

The documents provided only mention Super Bowl MVPs from 1967 to Super Bowl 57, but not Super Bowl 2022.", "docs": ["The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy.", "The Rams' WR1 had the most receptions ever in a single playoff run (33). He finished with 478 receiving yards and six touchdowns in the postseason, trailing only Larry Fitzgerald (546 receiving yards and seven touchdowns in 2008) in league history. \"I’m just so thankful for everyone that’s been in my life, that’s encouraged me and been with me every step of the way,\" Kupp said when asked about winning Super Bowl MVP.  His Super Bowl performance was merely a continuation of Kupp's playing big in the biggest moments. In the NFC Championship game, he finished with a game-high 11 catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the San Francisco 49ers to get Los Angeles to the Super Bowl. He also had two big catches to help put Los Angeles into field-goal position in his team’s three-point win over Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the divisional round. Kupp finished as the triple crown champion in the regular season, leading the NFL in receptions (145), receiving yards (1,947) and receiving touchdowns (16). Based on that production, he won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year.  For the season, Stafford and Kupp connected on 22 scores, second-most in league history behind Brady and Randy Moss, who had 24 in 2007.", "Making matters worse, the Rams could not run the football, totaling just 43 yards on the ground. But on the deciding drive, they moved the ball 79 yards on 15 plays for the winning score.  Kupp finished with three catches for 30 yards on the drive. He also ran for a critical first down on fourth-and-1 from L.A.’s 30-yard line, scampering 7 yards on an end-around to keep the chains moving. In addition, he coaxed two defensive penalties in the end zone to get Los Angeles closer to scoring position. \"That’s hard work, hours spent together,\" Stafford said when asked about the chemistry between him and Kupp. \"I just thank Coach for putting it in our hands: ‘Hey, Matthew, you and Coop go get this thing done.’ He kept calling plays for him, finding ways to get him the ball, and he made unbelievable plays. That’s what he does.\" Added Sean McVay: \"We were able to get them into some more regulated looks by playing fast. They still were tight-window throws. [Cincinnati] made it really difficult tonight. I’ve got a lot of respect for the Bengals’ defense, but we were able to find a way.\"  Kupp became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP and the first since Julian Edelman took home the trophy in Super Bowl LIII.", "GLENDALE, Ariz. — For the second time of his career, Patrick Mahomes is a Super Bowl champion and Super Bowl MVP. The Chiefs quarterback was named the Super Bowl 57 MVP after he led Kansas City to a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He is the sixth player ever to win multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. Mahomes went 21 of 27 passing for 182 yards and three touchdowns despite playing on a ginger ankle that was reaggravated in the first half. He also added 44 rushing yards in the win. The Chiefs trailed 24-14 at halftime and rattled off 24 second-half points. Mahomes and the Chiefs scored on every possession in the second half.  Prior to Sunday, teams that trailed by at least 10 points at halftime were 1-26 in the Super Bowl, per NFL Research. Kansas City rallied back and became the second team to erase at least a 10-point deficit. Super Bowl 57 was the first time two Black quarterbacks started against each other in a Super Bowl. Appropriately, the championship game was a showcase of spectacular performances between Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. Mahomes’ Super Bowl 57 MVP capped off a stellar year for the Chiefs quarterback. He led the NFL with 5,250 passing yards and 41 touchdowns in the regular season, the only quarterback to eclipse 5,000 passing yards and 40 touchdowns this year.", "7] The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVII held on February 12, 2023, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.  Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players—Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes—have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}
