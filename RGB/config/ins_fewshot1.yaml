  The final was held at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, with Argentina facing defending champions France. The match ended in a 3-3 draw after regular time, leading to extra time. Argentina then defeated France 4-2 in a penalty shootout, winning the championship. This victory marked Argentina's second World Cup title, following their win in 1986, and it had been 36 years since their last World Cup triumph. Croatia defeated Morocco 2-1 to claim third place. The 2022 World Cup also saw the introduction of Semi-automated Offside Technology (SAOT), which uses artificial intelligence to assist VAR officials in making faster offside calls.
  Before the start of the tournament, criticism of Qatar reached its peak in Europe and the Americas, leading to the 'Sleeve Badge Action' by seven European representative teams and widespread boycott sentiments in Europe and the Americas. The criticism and controversy surrounding Qatar even became a topic of discussion at the opening ceremony.
  This World Cup made Qatar the smallest country ever to host the event. The last country to hold this record was Switzerland, which hosted the 1954 World Cup and has a land area more than three times that of Qatar.
  At that World Cup, South Korea lost 2-3 to Turkey and finished fourth. South Korea will compete in the next round of the finals in Group H with Portugal, Ghana, and Uruguay.
  Question:
  The teams in the final of the Qatar World Cup.
  Answer:
